Johnnie Walker Blue Label 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,97,225,Magnificently powerful and intense. Caramels dried peats elegant cigar smoke seeds scraped from vanilla beans brand new pencils peppercorn coriander seeds and star anise make for a deeply satisfying nosing experience. Silky caramels bountiful fruits of ripe peach stewed apple orange pith and pervasive smoke with elements of burnt tobacco. An abiding finish of smoke dry spices and banoffee pie sweetness. Close to perfection. Editor's Choice
Black Bowmore 1964 vintage 42 year old 40.5%,Single Malt Scotch,97,4500,What impresses me most is how this whisky evolves; it's incredibly complex. On the nose and palate this is a thick viscous whisky with notes of sticky toffee earthy oak fig cake roasted nuts fallen fruit pancake batter black cherry ripe peach dark chocolate-covered espresso bean polished leather tobacco a hint of wild game and lingering leafy damp kiln smoke. Flavors continue on the palate long after swallowing. This is what we all hope for (and dream of) in an older whisky!
Bowmore 46 year old (distilled 1964) 42.9%,Single Malt Scotch,97,13500,There have been some legendary Bowmores from the mid-60s and this is every bit their equal. All of them share a remarkable aroma of tropical fruit which here moves into hallucinatory intensity: guava mango peach pineapple grapefruit. There’s a very light touch of peat smoke more a memory of Islay than the reality. Concentrated; even at low strength the palate is silky heady and haunting and lasts forever in the dry glass. A legend is born. (Eight bottles only for the U.S.) Editor's Choice.
Compass Box The General 53.4%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,96,325,With a name inspired by a 1926 Buster Keaton movie only 1698 bottles produced and the news that one of the two batches is more than 30 years old the clues were there that this blend was never going to be cheap. It isn't but it's superb rich in flavor that screams dusty old oak office fresh polish and Sunday church with spices oak dried fruits squiggly raisins and a surprising melting fruit-and-nut dairy chocolate back story.
Chivas Regal Ultis 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,96,160,Captivating enticing and wonderfully charming this first blended malt from Chivas Regal contains selections of five Speyside malts: Strathisla Longmorn Tormore Allt-a-Bhainne and Braeval. Red apple cherry raspberry fudge peach and mango fruit salad dusting of cinnamon and dry heather sprigs. In essence it’s rich and satisfying with dark vanilla apricot Bourneville-covered Brazil nuts and tangerine smoothed over by caramel and wood spices maltiness and gingersnap biscuits. Quite heavenly. Editor's Choice
Ardbeg Corryvreckan 57.1%,Single Malt Scotch,96,85,Powerful muscular well-textured and invigorating. Even within the realm of Ardbeg this one stands out. The more aggressive notes of coal tar damp kiln anise and smoked seaweed are supported by an array of fruit (black raspberry black cherry plum) dark chocolate espresso molasses bacon fat kalamata olive and warming cinnamon on the finish. Quite stunning!
Gold Bowmore 1964 vintage 42.4% ,Single Malt Scotch,96,6250,Deep gold color. Surprisingly lively on the nose for its age. A complex array of fruit (tangerine sultana pink grapefruit papaya and the general overall citrus DNA that you’ll find in old Bowmores) with balancing notes of honey and vanilla. A hint of damp smoke and coconut. Just like with Black Bowmore this is a texturally soothing whisky on the palate which continues to evolve in waves -- first the sweet honey coating vanilla and lively fruit then turning quite visceral with juicy oak damp earth deep peat smoke and charcoal followed by another wave of fruit (this time dried fruit) finishing off with subtle charred oak and roasted nuts. This whisky is better than White Bowmore and it falls just short of Black Bowmore (which I rated 97) because it’s just a bit softer and less vibrant on the palate.
Bowmore 40 year old 44.8%,Single Malt Scotch,96,11000,Definitely showing its age but not in a bad way — the distillery character is still there. Solid foundation of thick chewy toffee old pot still rum and fig cake. Fruity too with notes of golden raisin and nectarine. Soft seductive peat smoke juicy oak cinnamon and brine round out the palate. Excellent balance! One of the finest Bowmore whiskies I’ve ever tasted (and at this price will probably never taste again.) (Editor's Pick) 
The Dalmore 50 year old 52.8%,Single Malt Scotch,96,1500,The Dalmore is one of a handful of whiskies that seem to be able to age in the cask for many decades and still improve. This one is incredibly viscous on the nose and palate (and very heavy on the tongue) with chewy toffee and old pot still rum. The classic Dalmore marmalade note shines throughout along with vanilla cream an array of dried spices (especially cinnamon and evergreen) juicy oak forest bedding rancio old armagnac polished leather tobacco maple syrup dark chocolate almond macaroon and subtle espresso. Long mouth-coating finish. The flavors evolve like waves lapping on the palate -- especially the interplay with the oak. I can’t drink this whisky slowly enough. A rare experience for the lucky few who can afford it. (Price is per 100ml).
Glenfarclas Family Casks 1954 Cask #1260 47.2%,Single Malt Scotch,96,3360,A rich amber color and elegantly oxidized notes greet you. There are luscious old fruits—pineapple dried peach apricot—and puffs of coal-like smokiness. In time sweet spices (cumin especially) emerge. Superbly balanced. The palate while fragile still has real sweetness alongside a lick of treacle. It can take a drop of water allowing richer darker fruits to emerge. The finish is powerful long and resonant. Superb not over-wooded and a fair price for such a rarity. £1995
The Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1969 vintage 50.8%,Single Malt Scotch,96,750,It's great that Glenlivet releases whiskies under the 'Cellar Collection' label. It really shows the true potential of Glenlivet. This bottling is classic ultra-matured Glenlivet and rivals the 1959 vintage Cellar Collection as the best one ever. An incredibly complex whisky with notes of vanilla ripe barley coconut and caramel. All this is accentuated by glazed orange hazelnut and a potpourri of dried spices. Not the least bit tired for such an aged whisky. (Only 800 bottles for the U.S.)
Macallan 1976 Vintage 29 year old cask #11354 45.4%,Single Malt Scotch,96,1500,Classic sherry cask-aged Macallan. Antique amber with hints of ruby. Thickly textured complex and quite deep with notes of toffee ripe pit fruit raisin apple pie dried spice (cinnamon clove ginger and mint) and a wisp of smoke. An exceptional multi-faceted Macallan! 
The Last Drop (distilled at Lochside) 1972 (cask 346) 44%,Grain Scotch Whisky,96,3108,A remarkable beauty from the Angus town of Montrose. The elegant nose shows a dram at peace with itself; golden syrup hay bales ground hazelnut liquid honey French baguette High Mountain oolong and rubbed spice blends. Refreshing palate of honey toffee citrus honeycomb wax and a profusion of sweet vanilla. Rich sweet oak and deep pepper notes to finish. Truly a sublime and venerable grain. (106 bottles) £2400
Compass Box Flaming Heart (10th Anniversary bottling) 48.9%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,95,105,A marriage of three different single malts aged in American and French oak. This whisky shows the advantage of marrying whiskies from more than one distillery (when properly done). Vibrant with a complex array of fruit (orchard fruit sultana) sweetness (light toffee marzipan honeyed malt) spice (creamy vanilla mocha warming pepper) smoke (tar smoked olive coal) and lesser notes of toasted almond and beach pebbles. More smoke and tar on the palate than the nose yet always in balance. Well played! (Editor's Choice)
Compass Box The Peat Monster 10th Anniversary Special Cask Strength Bottling 54.7%,Blended Scotch Whisky,95,120,As you’d expect solid peat is the first thing out of the glass but this isn’t just a peat beast. Underneath are honey dried fruit and malt. The palate is all about balance with honeyed malt raisin and oak spice all complementing smoky peat. A lush mouthfeel makes you forget it’s cask strength. A pure love note in a glass from Compass Box to Park Avenue Liquor.  (Park Avenue Liquor only)
Johnnie Walker Blue Anniversary 60%,Blended Scotch Whisky,95,3500,Formulated to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Johnnie Walker. This is a fabulous whisky for anyone who can spring for the bottle. It is deep dark and quite powerful with a hefty malt foundation and sweeter notes of toffee and vanilla combined with resinous oak complex fruit (both bright citrus notes and darker pit fruits) crisp mint tobacco polished leather and heavy peat smoke. A tour de force of a blended scotch-as big as many single malts reviewed here. 
Chivas 18 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,95,70,An essay in balance on both the aroma and palate. Silky layers of delicate sweetness (honeyed vanilla caramel light toffee) permeate through clean delicate fruit (citrus peach currant) and subtle complex dried spice. Clean finish with a hint of dark chocolate. A very versatile very drinkable blend which suits most moods and occasions. Indeed a benchmark blended scotch.
Ardbeg 1974 Vintage Cask #3145 49.9%,Single Malt Scotch,95,20000,Cask #3145 is the lighter in color and the sweet notes that balance the smoke and seaweed are not as deeply caramelized as Cask #3542. I’m tasting hints of shortbread and caramel which show through the peat smoke tobacco toasted nuts firm spice notes (cinnamon clove and mint) and lingering brine. Very complex. Price listed includes the entire Double Barrel 1974 Vintage set.
Ardbeg Uigeadail 54.2%,Single Malt Scotch,95,70,With the Ardbeg 17 year old off the market it is nice to see a new Ardbeg in the line-up. Uigeadail costs about the same as the Ardbeg 17 did but with Uigeadail you are getting a much more interesting whisky. Uigeadail consists of a marriage of younger whisky (from 1990 and 1993) with much older whisky matured in sherry casks. The marriage works exceptionally well with the younger whiskies providing the classic Ardbeg intensity many of us have come to expect while the older whiskies contribute depth maturity and complexity. And bottling the whisky at cask-strength without chill-filtration ensures that none of the flavors are stripped out. This is an incredibly complex Islay whisky with its bonfire smoke brine and peppered olive notes balanced by a taming sweetness of vanilla marshmallow and toffee. Interwoven notes of candied fruit and sugared almonds round out the palate. Incredibly long finish.
Balvenie 1973 43 year old 46.6%,Single Malt Scotch,95,15000,This expression was matured in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. Overtly sherried with figs sultanas cinnamon and old warm leather on the nose. Finally fragrant with milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. The Turkish delight carries over to the palate before the chocolate darkens to plain with raisins smoked ham and cloves in the long finish. Remarkably almost no tannic oak. Textbook stuff.
Bowmore 50 year old (distilled 1961) 40.7%,Single Malt Scotch,95,26650,The whisky is sensational a glorious mix of ginseng syrup baked banana semi-dried tropical fruits and an exotic smoked edge. Without the last you could believe it was a delicate Cognac. In time there’s peppermint and guava syrup. A sip is all you need to reveal perfect thrilling harmony: light nuttiness pollen subtle fruits gentle smoke and light fungal touches. It’s stunning but it’s £16000! Whisky this great even in limited quantities should be fairly priced. Points off. £16000
Brora 30 year old 55.7%,Single Malt Scotch,95,400,Astonishingly fresh and clean for 30 years in oak and with incredible depth. Slight oily texture. Appetizing brine with honeyed vanilla mustard seed green olive Seville orange and lemon zest. Underlying smoke damp peat and seaweed. Put simply Brora at its finest. 
Lombard 'Jewels of Scotland' (distilled at Brora) 1982 vintage 50%,Single Malt Scotch,95,200,Bottled in 2004 but just recently put in circulation here in the U.S. (Very strange.) It’s worth the wait. It’s fresh (even at 22 years old) appetizing spicy and briny. There’s a sweet foundation of vanilla wafer and caramel with a slightly oily texture. White pepper seaweed mustard seed lime gherkin and teasing gin botanicals add complexity. Spicy salty finish. A vibrant dynamic expression of the shuttered original Clynelish distillery. Quite stunning actually. Find yourself a bottle before they’re gone!
Brora 30 year old (2009 Release) 53.2%,Single Malt Scotch,95,400,This whisky has all the positive aspects of a very mature whisky (depth complexity) without all the negative ones (excessive oak one-dimensional). Very clean but oily in texture with honeyed vanilla caramel citrus (tangerine orange lemon) nectarine olive brine black pepper ginger cut grass mustard seed and just the hint of teasing smoke. Briny spicy finish. Wonderful!
Brora 2010 54.3%,Single Malt Scotch,95,455,Though Brora has acquired cult status it has to be said that for a few years these Special Release Broras went through an off-putting butyric phase which might well have put. One nose of the 2010 SR shows that these days have been consigned to the past. This is classy from the word go. Gold in color; the nose manages to be both overtly waxy — I’m reminded of waxed paper — and fragrant. Behind that is coal smoke rather than the heavy peatiness of earlier vintages (Brora’s peating levels varied in its last years). In other words this is robust and powerful with an evocative aroma that speaks of old sea chests the seashore and vellum. Hugely concentrated with massed fruits — quince especially — following behind. This is amplified with a drop or two of water off newbies to this legendary closed site who must have wondered what all the fuss was about.
Brora 35 year old 49.9%,Single Malt Scotch,95,750,Maturation of this 1978 distillate has taken place in European oak and refill American oak casks. Fresh and fruity on the early herbal nose; a hint of wax plus brine developing walnut fudge and an underlying wisp of smoke. Finally wood resin. The palate is very fruity with mixed spices then plain chocolate damp undergrowth gentle peat smoke and finally coal. Mildly medicinal. Ashy peat and aniseed linger in the long slowly drying finish. Brora at its very best. (2944 bottles) Editor's Choice
Glenfarclas 1968 Vintage 43% ABV,Single Malt Scotch,95,200,It has been quite a while since we have seen a new Glenfarclas here in the U.S. but after tasting this whisky it was worth the wait. Glenfarclas is a rich stylish whisky that ages very well and this 1968 vintage proves it. It is very deep and mature with complex fruit (sultana marmalade) layered by sweetness (honey caramel and toffee). All those years in oak contribute another dimension to the whisky providing a dry oaky spiciness polished leather and a hint of tobacco-especially on the finish. Never does the whisky taste tired or excessively woody. It expresses all that is good about an older whisky without any of the down side. I'm told that most of the 1400 bottles imported to the U.S. went to the Chicago area. It is worth taking the extra time to track down a bottle.
Glenfarclas 40 year old 46%,Single Malt Scotch,95,460,Glenfarclas has a proven track record for aging very well. I’ve enjoyed some amazing 25 and 30 year old expressions in addition to some older vintage offerings. Does this new 40 year old follow suit? Absolutely! It’s complex and well-rounded with great depth and no excessive oak. Lush candied citrus (especially orange) old pot still rum maple syrup fig roasted nuts and polished leather with hints of mocha candied ginger and tobacco. A bit oily in texture (which I find soothing) with good tannic grip on the finish. A classic well-matured Glenfarclas — and a very good value for its age. (Editor's Choice)
Glenglassaugh 40 year old 44.6%,Single Malt Scotch,95,2525,An excellent example of an ultra-mature sherried whisky done the right way. Much darker and more decadent than the other two releases here. Silky texture. Rummy jammy fruit toasted walnut leather spice (cinnamon clove) tobacco and dark chocolate with a foundation of juicy oak. Tasting this whisky you know it’s old but you also know it’s very good. 
The Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1973 vintage 49%,Single Malt Scotch,95,1250,A marriage of three casks one of them an ex-sherry butt. The sherry is certainly evident and this is more sherried than many of the Cellar Collection whiskies to date. Opulent and seductive with prominent fruit (glazed spiced oranges ripe peach and hints of pineapple and coconut) caramel-coated nuts and vanilla custard. A peppering of ginger and cinnamon throughout. Coating soothing finish. Polished and seamless with no trace of excessive oak. One of the richest -- and finest -- Cellar Collections to date. Anyone willing and able to cough up the bucks for this whisky will be richly rewarded. (Only 240 bottles available in the U.S. beginning June 2010.)
