Compass Box The General 53.4%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,96,325,With a name inspired by a 1926 Buster Keaton movie only 1698 bottles produced and the news that one of the two batches is more than 30 years old the clues were there that this blend was never going to be cheap. It isn't but it's superb rich in flavor that screams dusty old oak office fresh polish and Sunday church with spices oak dried fruits squiggly raisins and a surprising melting fruit-and-nut dairy chocolate back story.
Chivas Regal Ultis 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,96,160,Captivating enticing and wonderfully charming this first blended malt from Chivas Regal contains selections of five Speyside malts: Strathisla Longmorn Tormore Allt-a-Bhainne and Braeval. Red apple cherry raspberry fudge peach and mango fruit salad dusting of cinnamon and dry heather sprigs. In essence it's rich and satisfying with dark vanilla apricot Bourneville-covered Brazil nuts and tangerine smoothed over by caramel and wood spices maltiness and gingersnap biscuits. Quite heavenly. Editor's Choice
Compass Box Flaming Heart (10th Anniversary bottling) 48.9%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,95,105,A marriage of three different single malts aged in American and French oak. This whisky shows the advantage of marrying whiskies from more than one distillery (when properly done). Vibrant with a complex array of fruit (orchard fruit sultana) sweetness (light toffee marzipan honeyed malt) spice (creamy vanilla mocha warming pepper) smoke (tar smoked olive coal) and lesser notes of toasted almond and beach pebbles. More smoke and tar on the palate than the nose yet always in balance. Well played! (Editor's Choice)
Compass Box The Peat Monster 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,94,60,The formula for this whisky has changed slightly since its inception -- and I think for the better. They've added some Laphroaig into the mix of Caol Ila and Ardmore. This whisky demonstrates the layered complexity that can be achieved by marrying whisky from different distilleries and different regions. I particularly enjoy the rich maltiness and oily texture that provide firm bedding and flavor contrast to the classic Islay notes: tar boat docks brine smoked olive seaweed and kiln ash. More subtle cracked peppercorn mustard seed and citrus fruit add complexity. Long warming finish. Amazing how a small change in composition can significantly benefit the overall flavor profile of a whisky.
Blue Hanger 6th Release Berry Bros. & Rudd 45.6%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,94,84,If you want proof that blended malts can be world class you'll find it in any bottle of Blue Hanger. Lovingly created by Berry Bros. whisky maker Doug McIvor every release has been exceptional. Even by the series' own high standards this sixth release surpasses itself. The nose is fresh clean and citrusy with wafts of sherry. But there are smoky hints too. And it's that peaty earthy note on the palate that gives this release a new dimension enriching the fruity Speyside sweetness at the whisky's core. The age and quality of the malt asserts itself throughout. This really is stunning stuff. Â£68
Collectivum XXVIII (Diageo Special Releases 2017) 57.3%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,94,164,An incredibly complex creation using stock from Diageo's 28 operational single malt distilleries this has minted toffee gummy bears raw gooseberry fresh whole grain bread and earthy spices shaken over sweet banoffee pie. Rich fruit cocoa granular white chocolate dark citrus waxy caramel bars nutmeg cinnamon and bitter dark chocolate. Water stimulates green fruit notes. A beautiful sugared almond note materializes with sweet fudge and dried apple dipped in chocolate. Â£125
Compass Box Oak Cross 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,50,This has long been a core whisky for Compass Box but the latest version of it is spicier and fresher than I recall and without doubt it's my new best friend. Virgin French oak heads help to contribute oriental and aromatic spices on the nose with hints of melon and pineapple candy sweets. The taste is a delight with spearmint soft toffee sweet citrus fruit lemonade mixed with beer and strawberry wafers. An array of spices from cinnamon to chili to ginger dominate the finish.
Compass Box Flaming Heart 2015 Edition 15th Anniversary 48.9%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,150,Without dredging up all the brouhaha over the particulars of the component malts this exemplary whisky has a balance you could rest on a pinhead. Earthy peats discarded fish boxes and crisp bacon rind combine in a smokiness you can really get into while there is honey sweetness macadamia nuts and a bouquet of early summer flowers. It dances upon the tongue sweet with toasted spices anchored by dark citrus and with a telling waxiness to the mouthfeel. Get some.
Compass Box Spice Tree Extravaganza 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,140,Recognizably Spice Tree but it's richer more dapper traveling in style and wearing better shoes. Peanut brittle toasted coconut and pale light sherry. Honeyed palate with caramelized sugar red apple and red berry fruit before the gingersnaps and clove bite. It revs up with another spicy blast for the finish. A tasty fifth Tenth Anniversary bottling from Compass Box; just don't let yesterday take up too much of today. (12240 bottles)
Johnnie Walker Odyssey 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,1100,Jim Beveridge delivered these aromas of toffee apple peach and rich berry fruits by working with European oak casks. The smoke is timid with hints of background salinity. The finely structured mouthfeel is where this triple malt whisky truly shines: the polished smoothness is exceptional. The flavor journey begins with honey citrus and swirling melted chocolate building to a fire of squeezed orange oils dry fruits and pecan nuttiness before concluding with rich espresso dark caramels and plain chocolate. Immaculate.
Sheep Dip Islay Blended Malt 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,60,There has been an excellent streak of Islay blended malts recently and here is another worthy contender from the Spencerfield Spirit Company. This one offers the sizzle of bacon fat thick clods of peat cocoa and breezy smoke. The rounded palate has sweet satsuma spice generous malty notes and burnt caramel. The wafting smoke builds until it engulfs the back of the palate. You will be wanting one of these.
Douglas Laing Big Peat Christmas 2013 54.9%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,76,Launched a few years ago with a Dr. Haddock-like cartoon figure on the label Big Peat does just what it suggests it doesâ€¦and then some. It's a mix of Islay peated malts and includes some Port Ellen but don't get distracted by that. Instead indulge yourself in the biggest peatiest oiliest earthiest grungiest gunkiest slab of industrial malt this side of a leaky steam engine. This whisky just gets better and better.
Big Peat 25 year old 52.1%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,236,Peat has grown up to become the best version of himself that he can be. The mellow sweet smoke makes all your cares drift away. It's like walking on an Islay beach through seaweed stranded at the high-tide mark. Lemon lozenges Sweethearts flashes of citrus stewed apple and growing smoke. The gentle glossy mouth-coating finish generates an urge to expertly puff smoke rings out through pursed lips. (300 bottles) Â£175
Exclusive Blend 1993 23 year old 50%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,145,You are missing a trick if you don't snap up these small batch blended malts when you see them. Savory beef juices black fruits particularly black currant loose Keemun tea and dense oak characteristics. Sweet baked orange with notable alcohols initially then tangy with caramelized brown sugar butterscotch dark rum Brazil nut pepper cacao and black currant puree. With water it tastes deliciously of chocolate. A serious heavyweight whisky.
Compass Box Flaming Heart Batch #2 48.9%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,85,Balanced Islay whiskies combine peat smoke characteristics with a sweet foundation. They're not one-dimensionally smoky. This whisky is an excellent example. This is a peat-laden whisky with refinement and grace. Creamy vanilla caramel and honey harmoniously marry with persistent -- yet controlled -- peat smoke. Crisp spice notes and dancing fruit throughout adds complexity. Well done.
Compass Box Monster 54.9%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,85,(Exclusive to Park Ave. Liquors New York NY) This is a vatting of two single malts: the malty and sometimes smoky Ardmore and the always smoky and spicy Caol Ila. The whisky expresses smartly complex aromas of smoky bonfire smothered with peat with notes of tar olives freshly ground pepper and seaweed. A sweet maltiness (from the Ardmore?) binds the flavors together. On the palate the whisky begins sweet then the powerful peat smoke emerges yielding to olives peppery spices and seaweed. The finish is long and powerful with the peat smoke again emerging and lingering on seemingly forever. A monster indeed. This whisky's complexity demonstrates the virtues of vatting. Many smoky whiskies have nothing else going on behind the cloak of smoke. This one does.
Compass Box The Peat Monster Reserve Edition 48.9%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,150,Compass Box Whiskies celebrates the fifth anniversary of The Peat Monster by thinking big: bigger intensity put into a bigger bottle. This bold whisky is packed with Islay and coastal character showing tarry rope brine and a hint of seaweed along with teasing smoked olive anise and mustard seed. There is some civility to the whisky: sweeter notes of vanilla wafer baked apple ripe peach and cream attempt to soften the blow. Smoke and tar on the finish. Nicely done. (Price is per 1.75L.) 
Compass Box Flaming Heart 2012 Edition 48.9%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,115,In my book the bar can't be set much higher than it is for Flaming Heart and this latest version doesn't disappoint though it does head off into a scuzzier grittier and more peaty direction than the 10th anniversary bottling and has lost some of the black currant fruitiness in the process. No matter: this smolders with peaty and fishy intensity works its way round to tinned strawberries damson and berry fruits and emerges sooty and smoky. A BIG whisky.
Compass Box Peat Monster 10th Anniversary Limited Edition 48.9%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,130,Peat Monster is a staple Compass Box blended malt whisky but this raises the bar significantly. The nose is â€œas you wereâ€: peat reek seaside very Islay. But on the palate John Glaser's added some peaty Highland whiskyâ€”probably a signature Clynelishâ€”to add a hint of licorice a softer fruitier smoke base and through some virgin French oak a delightful spiciness. Compass Box is in a purple patch. Again.
Sheep Dip 'Old Hebridean' 1990 vintage 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,70,A marriage of Dalmore Fettercairn and Ardbeg and their personalities certainly show. The whisky was blended and then aged for an additional 15 years -- very atypical. The marriage of the three really works very well combining a rich sweetness (honeyed malt toffee) with spice brine vanilla bitter chocolate charcoal espresso tobacco cigar ash subtle marmalade and firm -- but not dominating -- leafy peat smoke. Thick nicely-textured body too. Lingering brine and smoke on the finish. Delicious as it is I can only imagine what it would be like bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered. (I probably would be bumping it up a few points.)
Blue Hanger 4th Release Berry Bros. & Rudd 45.6%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,75,This Blue Hanger has sherry and fruit on the nose but it's all reined in. Then the palate is big rich complex and fruity and late oakiness from some 30 year-plus malt in the mix brings the perfect finale. Â£61
Blue Hanger 7th Release Limited Edition 45.6%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,100,What a success story. After six releases in a decade there have been three just this year. This release is especially for the States and it's a fireball. There are dried fruits and dusty bookshelves on the nose and tropical fruits with water. On the palate it's a big peaty rich whisky with licorice and more of the pineapple kiwifruit and guava. You get the whole fairground in the finale with candy fruit and smoke. Excellent.
Blue Hanger 11th Limited Release 45.6%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,137,It's the intensity of flavor that just grabbed me by the lapels and spun me round. It harbors intense tangelo juiciness; that unparalleled concentration of deep citrus skillfully mingled with dark vanilla dried apricots and gentle smoke. This goes the distance delivering wave after delicious wave: peach juice mandarin pineapple cubes and lemon zest. A firm unctuous finish shows a little charred wood and dark sugar cloaked in fine smoke. Tongue pleasing and very special indeed.Â Â£90
Big Peat Small Batch 53.6%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,48,The original Big Peat was a mix of smoky Islay malts and was already up there with the very best competition in the category even though many of the others were bottled at cask strength. I scored it at 90. Now it's back to play in the big boys' pool with a killer cask strength whisky of its own. This is to whisky what AC/DC is to heavy rock: old school predictable but great and exactly what fans want.
Big Peat Christmas Edition 2015 53.8%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,70,Marginally less aggressive than in 2014 this Big Peat is more rounded and exhibits greater finesse. Overall it's a better whisky. The invasive smoke still infiltrates the skull and clasps your brain tightly. A sweet smoke of smoldering hillside wildfire extinguished by rubber beaters balanced by meadow flowers tree blossom and honey. Sticky lemons smeared in thick honey cracked black pepper and a fabulous almost gelatinous texture it builds solidly in peaty intensity. Knockout! A hot smoky finish like dragon's breath.
Exclusive Blend 1991 21 year old 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,100,From whisky connoisseur David Stirk's Exclusive Malts Single Cask Cask Strength range this is a blend made with 80% malt and it shows. This is a beauty. It's also a â€˜traffic light' whisky with the sort of whisky rancio associated with the oldest whiskies up front peaches and cream and pureed fruit in the center and changing to oaky spiciness late on. Whisky with body depth and balance which morph seamlessly. Very good indeed.
The Feathery 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,66,Chocolate-covered raisins scoffed on a heathery moor leather riding tack intense plain chocolate malt loaf mixed nuts Medjool dates and traces of wood ash. A gorgeous unctuous mouthfeel with flavors spun around bright sparks of orange dark toffee and rich maltiness melding to black cherry stewed fruits licorice and charred oak. Named for the leather golf balls packed with goose feathers used in the early 19th century. Sink one for a birdie. From the bottlers of Sheep Dip.Â Â£39
Compass Box Canto Cask 46 53.2%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,65,Aged in new French oak casks with long-toasted heads. Deliciously creamy sweet toasty profile with coconut cream toasted marshmallow toffee pudding and honeyed vanilla. Gentle spice notes (especially clove) and hints of fruit dance on the palate. Very soothing. (Bottled for Park Avenue Liquors.) 
Compass Box 'Lady Luck' 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,170,A marriage of two casks of Caol Ila (25 and 29 years old) and one cask of Imperial (14 years old). Penetratingly smoky visceral rooty and even mean-tempered at times ultimately being soothed by creamy vanilla and thick malt. It's peppered with licorice stick dark chocolate campfire charcoal subtle olive brine and teasing berried fruit. Long clinging finish. The flavors are nicely integrated and complex. Well done! (A limited release.)
Compass Box 3 year old Deluxe 49.2%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,300,Not the pimply youth you might be mistakenly expecting this tongue-in-cheek release is impishly contemptuous of the regulations challenged by Glaser during the transparency debate. Lemon bonbon heavy vanilla scents beeswax boot polish and white chocolate are well integrated with peat. The exotic fruits and citrus zest tumbling with golden syrup are knocked sideways by clove and pepper. Water provokes more sweet smoke. A dry spicy waxy finish remains. (3282 bottles)
Compass Box Spice Tree 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,65,The tastiest of their Signature range this boasts a dry oak and spice nose with fudge rye bread and banana interwoven with French oak influences of nutmeg cinnamon and ground ginger. As the gentle orange malt pear and apple settle down little spicy explosions of ginger and pepper detonate leaving an aftermath of spiced malt coffee cake milk chocolate and cocoa. Such a wonderful flavor trajectory to behold.
Cutty Sark Tam o' Shanter 25 year old 46.5%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,329,In my opinion Cutty Sark 25 year old is one of the great blends so a new version was always going to be a big ask. This one comes with a lot of packaging so is it a victory for style over substance? Not at all. This is all about big flavors; burnt orange juicy raisin and dark chocolate; rich oak and exotic spice. A treat and worthy of its heritage. But at that priceâ€”and bearing in mind it's a limited editionâ€”are you going to open it? 
Timorous Beastie 40 year old 54.7%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,246,There should be few qualms about snapping up this aged Highland gem given the blender's prowess and the generous pricing. Ripe stone fruit straw sweet oak and ground almond on the nose. For its advancing years it's quite a ride at full strength; thick glossy and mouth-coating with tangy sweet oranges fudge and candied citrus. Best sipped neat it ebbs away with bright orange fruit and buzzy spices. (1080 bottles) Â£200
Usquaebach An Ard Ri Cask Strength 57.1%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,200,This 2016 release in its ceramic flagon entices you with lemon soft fruits honey digestive biscuits and taffy candy. It's dense and weighty; oozing with flavors of barley sugar caramel sweet oak and some mature orange peel characteristics underpinned with ginger and pepper. Profoundly long sweet finish pricked with bitter orange and spice. One of those great drams that you can happily imbibe at cask strength without dilution. (2000 bottles)
Rock Oyster Sherry Edition 46.8%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,60,The salty coastal twang meets the sherry head on revealing mandarin gingerbread glazed ham clove seashells and driftwood bonfires built on pebble beaches. Smoke comes to dominate the sherry. Orange oils precede a delayed ignition of the spices. More honeyed sweetness comes through while a smothering layer of peat rises up. Warm spicy finish until a thick curtain of smoke closes it down. But hey this rocks.
Compass Box Last Vatted Malt 53.7%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,287,Not Compass Box at the very top of its game but pretty damn good nevertheless. This is a mix of malts from different distilleries and it has the company's distinctive DNA all over it combining siege cannon-strength peated malt with rich fruity sherried whisky. It's clumsier than the wonderful Flaming Heart but in the same ballpark and I have to declare an interest â€” I adore this combination when it's delivered right. Â£180 
Compass Box The Lost Blend 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,120,The smoking wicks of church candles smoked meat coastal notes cumin coriander seed and herbal elements. A sophisticated palate of unsweetened fruit. Peaches citrus and pineapple with a waxy presence building later on settles to a dry finish of herbs and beeswax. We can easily overlook the narcissism of making tributes to your own past bottlings as John Glaser turns whisky resurrectionist in homage to Eleuthera. Layered complex thought provoking and finely tuned for the connoisseur.
Compass Box Oak Cross 43%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,59,Compared to Asyla this has noticeable added richness fruit and spice. The nose brings apple danish creamy custard honey citrus peel and the fragrance of lightly toasted spices. Against a core of rich tangy fruits a spicy partnership of pepper and clove manifests under the tongue stealthily curls around the sides and storms the palate. The mouth-coating finish drips with mandarin and cooked apple pierced by clove.
Johnnie Walker Island Green 43%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,60,What happens when you light a bonfire underneath Green Label? Earthy peat smoke with medicinal characteristics of lanolin and antiseptic a salty tang balanced with creamy vanilla strands of citrus and touches of menthol and aniseed. Smooth as a thief in the night; mouth-coating toffee growing smoky notes and peppered mackerel push back the waxy citrus elements. Now the fire is alive; the sweetness gets out while it can. (Travel Retail exclusive)
Blue Hanger 9th Release 45.6%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,115,You have to take your hat off to Berry Bros. & Rudd's Doug McIvor who is whisky's answer to Bruce Springsteen: consistently brilliant complex spanning the generations and in the form of his life. This just doesn't let up with plenty of smoke and peat in the mix but with citrus fruits some plummy depths and a vanilla cushion. It's balanced perfectly. Born to run? You betcha.
Clan Denny Islay 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,45,It's not made clear which Islay malts are included in this blended malt but whoever's responsible for this has brought the big guns. This successfully pulls off an intense one-two with hard hitting Islay peat and brine on the one hand and some rich sweetness on the other making for a mouth-coatingly rich and intense whisky. The malts pack down together like a rugby scrum and combine with impressive intensity. â‚¬36
Duncan Taylor The Big Smoke 60 60%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,85,Does it do exactly what it says on the tin? You betcha! This is big and it's smoky and if you're a fan of Islay malts then it's right up your street. There's more to it than just smoke though. There's stewed apple on the nose as well as steam engine oil and on the palate there's gooseberry spearmint and apple pip. But as you'd expect the peat lingers. 
Douglas Laing Big Peat 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,55,So which independent bottler comes out in the 'Big' battle of the Islay blended malts? Given this is bottled at a lower strength and it's at a lower price I'm calling it a draw. The latest batch of this is the best yet with Ardbeg Caol Ila and Bowmore the main components although there is also some Port Ellen in the mix. So you know what to expectâ€”and it doesn't disappoint. Big AND peaty.
Big Peat Christmas Edition 2014 55.7%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,70,Brace yourself. This takes peat to the extreme conjuring up a moist chocolate slab of peat being cut and lifted out of the bog. So smoky you will feel like you're breathing in the dense clouds rising above the smoldering kilns. A punchy thwack of peat at full strength and even if you cut it with water it only highlights salty fishboxes and some buttery caramels cowering from the backdraft. A deliberately singular character but utterly brilliant nonetheless.Â Â£46
Rare Cask Reserves Blended Reserve 26 year old 42%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,399,William Grant & Sons will be releasing a series of Ghosted Reserves in the years ahead drawing on their remaining stock from closed distilleries. Here Brian Kinsman has used whisky from Ladyburn and Inverleven to create a nose of zesty key lime pie peach butter mintoes and sweet oak. It is truly moreish with creamy malty flavors of sweet mandarin marzipan and strawberry with a chalky mouthfeel of candy sticks that lingers through the finish. Exceptionally good whisky. (6000 bottles)
Scallywag Cask Strength 53.6%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,76,As if this cheeky devil from Douglas Laing wasn't good enough already! Strawberry napoleon mint leaves rubbed between finger and thumb runny honey fresh peach and wood whittled on the back porch. The sweet orange starts gossamer light then it hits the gas: the citrus becomes more tangy touching blood orange fizzy sweeties become taffy candy then sherbet. Eventually pacified it becomes milky and sweet with milk chocolate melting on the tongue. A creamy finish like a mother's embrace.Â Â£50
The Tweeddale Last Centennial 52.2%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,190,A limited edition cask strength blend of four single casks by Alasdair Day released to mark 100 years since the last entry in their blender's historic cellar book. The nose has warm caramel whole orange and a dry grassy and gristy note. Rich orange envelops the mouth with golden caramel shortbread and underlying spices of ginger and pepper. Takes water well and retains its character; lots to like here.
The Pearls of Scotland (distilled at Invergordon) 1972 43.4%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,246,Holy Moly! Where do they find them? Over 40 years old and this seizes your attention with a becoming nose of smoked ham sweet paprika and red currant jelly. It's extremely fruity with just the right level of tartness to keep it in balance; pomegranate strawberry laces crystalized fruits and a nip of licorice adding to the richness and emerging creaminess before a dry finish of Victoria plums. Simply a gorgeous old grain. (300 bottles for UK Europe Scandinavia and Japan)Â Â£155
Timorous Beastie 18 year old 46.8%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,108,Peach meringue whole apple runny honey vanilla eucalyptus and spices that are just about to burn in the pan. Lively and fresh Highland whisky flavor proffering sweet honey cooked apple dusted with icing sugar lime zest and a supportive lift of vibrant spices before diffusing into sugary squares of Scottish tablet. Water accentuates the peppermint in the finish and brings out sugary chocolate-mint flavors. One not to miss.
The Lost Distillery Company Classic Selection Towiemore 43%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,43,Built between Keith and Dufftown in 1898 but closed at the start of the 30s Towiemore's warehouses were still in use until 1993. Fresh peaches and fragrant florals rich orange roasted almond chips and hazelnut. Glenrothes connoisseurs will appreciate this one. Mellow and nutty with a good supple texture; baked peach dried peel mango and light spices with a candied peel and spice finish.
Shackleton 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,35,One hundred ten years after the Nimrod expedition blender Richard Paterson's adventurous marriage of over 20 Highland malts brings fresh green fruits manuka honey vanilla banana muffin cantaloupe fresh herbs spice and a wisp of smoke. Refreshing palate of green melon light honey vanilla cinnamon cooked apple and gooseberry becoming sour. More complexity on the finish: spice smoke cooked fruits and chalky Sweethearts candies. Pair with mature prosciutto.
Johnnie Walker Green Label 43%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,55,Just as complex as Johnnie Walker Gold but fuller and more richly textured. (Not surprising given that there are no grain whiskies in Johnnie Walker Green.) This is one of the finer vatted malts on the market. Its flavors are well-integrated. You'll find creamy toffee and nougat at its core which is then layered with notes of vanilla mint fresh brine and even a hint of mustard seed. Excitingly fresh and vibrant on the finish. A whisky for both the blend and single malt drinker. And at $55 it is also fairly valued for an all-malt whisky.
Double Barrel Ardbeg & Craigellachie 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,78,If I had to back one of the protagonists in Douglas Laing's latest Duel of the Phial my money would be squarely on the Ardbeg. The nose delights with oils oozing from the chestnut flesh of a grilled kipper coiled rope on a trawler's deck and hot pressed asphalt with a gentle background note of roasted peanut and millionaire's shortbread. Medium texture: lemon and butterscotch delicious fruitiness and spearmint on the mid-palate. Clean creamy with a baked lemon finish.Â Â£49
Cutty Sark Storm 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,31,Cutty Sark master blender Kirsteen Campbell has hit the ground running and is playing a leading role in the revival of this iconic blend. Storm is a very different whisky than Tam o' Shanter. The nose is nuanced and light with orange jelly and citrus juice; the palate is sophisticated fruity perfectly balanced rounded and gentle with a high-percentage malt content evident in the mix. The finish is quite short but very more-ish. An amazing whisky for the price. Â£20 VALUE PICK
Wemyss Malts Kiln Embers 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,64,This is so much more than a pumped-up version of Peat Chimney; this has sweet smoke from singed green wood twigs light honey peach all balanced with TCP-soaked bandages. Nothing harsh or off-putting it's just a delight. Sweet honey orange generous malt and caramel but it's the smoke coiling its way throughout that makes the greatest impression on the palate and finish. These blended malts tend to move quickly so grab one while you can. Perfect for winter drinking. (12000 bottles)Â Â£42
Clan Denny Speyside 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,45,If big smoke and peat don't float your boat and you'd rather metaphorically skip through a summer orchard while drinking whisky then the Speyside version of Clan Denny is the full fruit bowl. The mixing of malts means that sherry and bourbon Speysiders get a say so it's the complete package and there's lots going on. Ultimately though it's not quite as focused as the Islay. Damn close call though.â‚¬36
That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt #2 (batch 1) 48.3%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,74,These Boutique-y blends are delivering terrifically good whiskies time after time but the small batches sell through quickly now that the word is out. This one has plums apple mixed peel spices walnut and sherry notes. The palate is fizzy with plummy depths chocolate shavings ginger biscuits and dark fruits with a medium-weight mouthfeel. This can go toe-to-toe with the best of â€˜em. Once the ginger settles down it leaves a pleasing mild maltiness. Add water if you must. (370 bottles)Â Â£49
Poit Dhubh 21 year old Blended Malt 43%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,120,Pronounced â€œPot Dooâ€ this is without doubt a rugged coastal and/or island whisky but on a mild and temperate day. Salt spice and peat are all to the fore but it's a gentle giant of a whisky with some citrus drizzle and a light honeycomb heart. The main wood influence seems to soften the delivery so that the punch it packs won't floor you. Beautifully put together though.
Scallywag 13 year old 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,83,Scallywag is no lapdog; this mutt runs off the leash and disappears down a rabbit hole. The first thing that strikes is a spicy blast of cardamom fennel and onion seeds. Baked chestnut grapefruit baked orange plum and walnut aromas. Warm marmalade with thick peel a fanfare of spices and brown sugar cubes. Gratifying finish of grapefruit peel and a burning core of spice deep in the throat.
Peat Elements of Islay 59.3%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,46,Roasted spices more peat than smoke coastal breezes lemon creaminess bacon-flavored chips and carbolic soap. Disarmingly it starts with lemon apple and honey before brilliantly the pepper and chili heat slams into you like an Acme grand piano falling from the sky. Bitter chocolate notes velvety cocoa and dry orange peel with morning-after cigar smoke settling ash and roasted meat juices. Seriously impressive delivery of flavor from Oliver Chilton who has concocted a versatile dram at a terrific value. Â£35
Compass Box Eleuthera 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,50,Bright gold color. Fresh aromas of smoked olives brine exotic pepper and fried bacon. Rich in body and slightly oily in texture. In flavor this is a big dynamic whisky-smoked olives sea salt seaweed mustard seed all on a backdrop of vanilla sweetness. Long smoky finish. 
The Famous Grouse Malt Whisky 18 year old 43%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,55,Similar in profile to the 12 year old expression below except that the bouquet is thicker the sweetness is more caramelized and the fruit notes are drier (no surprises). There's also more depth and maturity in this whisky more oak spice and a longer drier finish. An excellent value! 
The Famous Grouse Celebration 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,126,Available only at the distillery or online and limited to 5000 special decanters this is a special Famous Grouse release to mark the 30th anniversary of the blend. Be careful though:  it's not a 30 year old blend. But it is excellent and there's lots of very old woody and ripe malt in the mix. As Highland Park and The Macallan are in the stable expect a fruity oaky superbly balanced treat.  Â£80
The Famous Grouse 40 year old 47.3%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,3378,Legendary master blender John Ramsay handpicked the casks for this whisky and the job was completed by his successor Gordon Motion. Puffy marshmallows nougat fallen orchard fruit green cardamom and clove; it's like all the threads pull together harmoniously. A lucid concentration of fruit mingles on the tongue preceding flavor advancement through spearmint menthol light peat smoke and burning orange oils. Sit back as it heads toward a spicy tingle of ginger apple and scorched coriander seed. Deservedly famous.Â Â£2000
Johnnie Walker The Spice Road 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,43,Somebody at Diageo has been taking a lot of interest in the Johnnie Walker range of late what with the revamp of the core range and now a regular stream of special releases. This is the first of a series for Travel Retail only but it takes the Johnnie Walker themes â€” vanilla spice and honey with wispy peat and smoke â€” and adds savory spice to the earthiness. But there are some very young notes in this. 
Wemyss Vintage Malt Ginger Compote 1996 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,84,The Wemyss range â€” overseen by Susan Colville â€” has been quietly building a deserved reputation for being among the most consistently enjoyable single cask bottlings. This new example hails from the mighty Benrinnes distillery but shows a milder side to its make â€” there is indeed ginger aplenty along with cumin crystallized fruit and jellied peach but behind is a deep earthy and slightly leathery note typical of â€˜The Ben.' It's these bass notes that dominate on the richly chewy palate. Best neat. Â£51 
Double Barrel Ledaig/Bowmore 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,49,The question with this sort of blended malt is whether the whole outperforms the sum of its parts. This is a big rich oily and peaty whisky suggesting both the Ledaigâ€”the peated version of Tobermory and often a bland maltâ€”and the Bowmoreâ€”capable of big smoke notes when it wants toâ€”are firing on all cylinders. There's not much subtlety to it but it's enjoyable all the same.â‚¬40
 Big Peat Christmas Edition 2017 54.1%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,70,Big Peat looks incredibly pale in the glass this year but his message is undiminished. Antiseptic pine-scented floor cleaner and an enveloping cloud of peat smoke with underlying peach and faint dabs of lemon. Sugary sweet with lemon lozenges light vanilla caramel and dark toffee while a bowling somersaulting smoky element gleefully turns cartwheels in the mouth. Hot dry finish like gargling with hot coals. Merry Peatmas everybody.
Douglas Laing Rock Oyster Cask Strength 57.4%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,61,A dense suffocating fog of peat smoke sea salt dry seaweed on the high tide and lemon-scented candles. Remember to come up for air once in a while. A supple silky texture of lemon mousse baked apple vanilla cinnamon ginger and a massive rush of pepper. Hold this in your mouth for as long as possible; the flavor delivery is impressively long and constantly evolving. Hot drying finish and frankly a relief from the peppery assault on the palate. Â£47
Storm 43%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,40,Treacle tarts black bun and polished antique furniture with fainter accents of dark chocolate espresso and delicate smoke flowing freely from the glass. Densely structured palate. Initially chocolate-coated coffee beans then it blossoms into dried fig date with a developing deep tangy chocolate orange note fading to dusty cocoa like the memory of a warm embrace. Not to be confused with Cutty Sark this Storm is bottled by the Whisky Shack Company.
The Pearls of Scotland (distilled at North of Scotland) 1971 43.3%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,262,The North of Scotland distillery (formerly Strathmore distillery) was a neighbor of Cambus and operated from 1957-1980 in Clackmannanshire. Bottlings are few and far between. This one is quite forward. Apple peelings baked apricot cinnamon nutmeg sherry notes with oak wood beef stock and adhesives. It tastes sweet vibrant and juicy with red berry fruits rosewater strawberry cream soda cherryade and cough linctus. A slightly bitter finish punctures the juiciness. (310 bottles for UK Europe Scandinavia and Japan)Â Â£165
Berrys' Islay Reserve 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,63,Gentle peat smoke mixed with smoldering wood shavings fresh maritime characteristics and milk chocolate but leave the glass a while and when you return the smoky intensity gets really pumped. Light melon flavors become engulfed by smoke then the pepper ginger and chili kick in leaving the soft fruit and vanilla cowering lamb-like in a corner. If you have peat smoke running in your veins you will love this.
Compass Box Enlightenment 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,80,This torchbearer for the Compass Box Scotch Whisky Transparency campaign is looking for your support. A fruit medley of lemon lime gooseberry cream and soft pineapple chunks. Ripe apple and pear from the orchard are given a fresh spicy lift and integrate with the vanilla and sweet toffee notes. It makes a clean exit with lengthy spices and juiciness never becoming bitter. One thing is clear it's a finely structured dram worthy of your vote. (5922 bottles)
Eades â€œDouble Maltâ€ Islay (Second Edition) 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,70,A marriage of two whiskies: 30% 18 year old Caol Ila finished in Chateau d'Yquem Sauternes casks and 70% 10 year old Bowmore finished in Grenache wine casks. A honeyed sultana sweetness (from the d'Yquem?) nicely tames the rooty smoke iodine seaweed brine pepper and subtle Spanish olive. Bramble and berried fruit (from the Grenache?) add another layer and dimension. A very dynamic whisky worthy of exploring and debating how well all these flavors integrate with each other.
Wemyss Malts (distilled at Blair Athol) Autumn Berries 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,132,Distilled in 1986 this single cask from Blair Athol distillery in Perthshire yielded 268 bottles and the nose offers sweet fruits principally apple and orange plus walnuts vanilla and brittle toffee. Becoming softer and creamier with time. Dark fruit notes on the palate notably blackcurrants and cranberries with caramel and cinnamon. The finish is quite viscous with a little oak freshly-squeezed lemons and licorice twists. Â£85 
Anchor Bay 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,48,Lombard's blend of Speyside malts pleases with an agreeable nose of orchard blossoms flower honey caramel dry hay and pears baked in brown granulated sugar. It's homey and comforting favoring its floral and fruity side. This is a light sweet whisky that sweeps around the mouth radiating maltiness apple grapefruit dried mango strips and mingling spices. A studiously long finish of sucked caramel candy and beeswax follows. A smart choice for the beginning of the evening.Â Â£30
That Boutique-y Whisky Company Islay Blended Malt #1 23 year old 46.3%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,102,This is a sophisticated and finessed take on Islay blended malt which must be Kilchoman-free given the age statement. Driftwood waxy lemons soft buttery fudge banana milkshake dry grasses and the gentlest puff of smoke promise calm seas ahead. A silken dram anointing the palate with lemon meringue pie honey and caramel. This becomes creamier with faint tendrils of smoke and dancing spices through to the finish. Utterly charming and tremendous value for the money. (419 bottles)Â Â£82
Rock Oyster 46.8%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,59,The final cornerstone of Douglas Laing's Remarkable Regional Malts range this blended malt celebrates the best from the Islands. The peat smoke finds harmony with the nose of pine lemon curd dewy lawns and vanilla fudge. This is gloriously full-flavored; the peatiness certainly delivers but there is a pleasant nip of saltiness too. The black pepper finish leads to a long lasting salty smack on the lips. Make this your hipflask essential for bracing excursions along the shoreline.Â Â£38
Douglas Laing Scallywag Cask Strength (batch 2) 54.1%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,62,Rich marmalade gingersnaps dried tropical fruits vanilla pods and cinnamon bark abound on this limited edition top dog whisky from Douglas Laing & Co which includes Mortlach Macallan and Glenrothes. The satsuma peel acidity settles quickly to show off its tricks of green apple spices hazelnut Maltesers and ginger. Late development brings out plain chocolate squares maltiness and intense coffee notes. Water picks out chocolate orange truffles. Coffee cups and chocolate biscuits to finish. My tail is wagging for more. (4800 bottles)Â Â£50
Highland Journey 46.2%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,63,This was inspired by Stewart Laing's childhood journeys by steam locomotive from Glasgow to Speyside with his father. Hunter Laing's blended malt includes contributions from Blair Athol Teaninich and Clynelish and raises toffee sauce dried banana chips and spring foliage with a fringe of fresh mint. You can appreciate the cool clean taste; ripe banana and chocolate-dipped fudge blooming into late notes of mocha ginger and chocolate mousse. Dry finish of ginger cookies and espresso. All aboard!Â Â£40
Haig Club 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,72,A confectioner's delight; Fry's Five Centres lime lemon kumquat iced buns fresh mint and crushed cardamom that matches the chocolate aromas. Those re-charred rejuvenated casks are very much in evidence here. It has a gilded satiny sheen glistening with lemon drizzle cake butterscotch orange matchsticks and banana bread. Incontrovertibly it inhabits a signature grain style but it fizzles out with a sticky sweet aftertaste like licking the spoon from the icing bowl.Â Â£45
Sovereign (distilled at Cameronbridge) 23 year old 1990 59.2%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,127,Appearances can be deceptive as this pallid specimen proves. Overripe honeydew melons lemon cheesecake sprinkled with zest vanilla pear muffins cooked apple spring blossoms and icing sugar. The sweet sugary opener is burnt out enjoyably by blistering burnt orange butterscotch and lemon bonbons. While the flavor intensity builds commendably it doesn't escape without a touch of astringency. Water makes this sing â€˜Oranges and Lemons' but go easy with it. The finish is like a greedy mouthful of tarte au citron.Â Â£80
Duncan Taylor The Big Smoke 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,60,The power of pure burning peat smoke lemon-scented floor polish pine needles salt spray and delicate vanilla places this squarely among the archetypal whiskies from Islay. Sweet lemon custard cream biscuits and hints of smoked goose lend an oily mouthfeel. A combustible climax of smoke spice and earthy peat kindle a red-hot finish that will have you puffing smoke like a chimney.
Royal Mile Whiskies 40 year old 47.1%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,288,A terrific value blend of Macallan Glenrothes and Tamdhu matured in sherry casks has produced one of the darkest whiskies on the market. Inescapable aromas of thick Seville orange marmalade polished saddle leather too-hot-to-hold sweet chestnuts pulled from a brazier dry fruitcake 100% cacao and Medjool dates. Sweet prunes chocolate ganache cola tannins and singed wood spices combine to produce a formidable proposition. Heavily sherried and oaky for sure; this has been bottled not a day too early. (337 bottles Royal Mile Whiskies only) Â£200
Rock Oyster 18 year old 46.8%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,116,Peat smoke dominates the nose of salt crystals green tea pine cones peppermint creams and charcoal. The tasty palate has sweet fudge heather honey and mandarin which balance out the ginger and light pepper spiciness. Smoke catches in the throat as it becomes fruitier in the later stages. Finish is hot drying with smoke and ginger spices. Decent enough though its appeal will skew toward peat lovers.
Treacle Chest 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,62,The new Wemyss Family Collection includes two blended malts; this is the better of the pair. Raisin date fruitcake stewed apple and plum cumin coriander allspice and new leather leave little mystery about the role played by the sherry hogshead. Gingerbread plum and dark orange draw the mouth. Fruity sweetness but never sugary; there are jam tarts walnut and minimal interference from the spices until the dry finish. (6300 bottles) Â£47
The Famous Grouse Malt Whisky 12 year old 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,35,Lovely balance on the nose and palate. Soft and gently textured too. The sweetness of the whisky (honey fruit gum drops and malty vanilla) dovetail nicely with light bright citrus and teasing dried spices. Heather/floral notes enhance the whisky's complexity. Clean delicately polished oak finish. A very versatile inexpensive easy-drinking whisky. 
Wemyss Malts Vanilla Summer Single Cask 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,79,The latest batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts includes Vanilla Summer. It is an unspecified Highland single malt distilled in 1997 and the bourbon cask in which it was matured has yielded 263 bottles. Vanilla buttercups and violets on the nose developing Bramley apples with peaches and cream. Background of mildly spicy malt. Sweet and floral on the palate with tropical fruits fudge and ginger. Slowly drying with benevolent oak but ultimately a lingering creaminess. Â£50 (Not available in the U.S.)
Blue Hanger 10th Blended Malt 45.6%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,100,With some powerhouse whiskies in the blend (including an '87 Bunnahabhain) it's a surprise that the nose is so reserved with citrus ginger and honey. On the palate you need your flavor shovel to unearth a core of typically strong flavors including leather oak salt dark chocolate and even rancio. It's delicious but highly elusive. The finish is medium and quite dry. What an odd blend. I haven't had to work this hard for a blend in a long time. (U.S. only)
That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt #2 18 year old (batch 3) 48%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,62,A delicious and inviting proposition this offers heather honey on toast marmalade dark vanilla and flapjack aromas. Soft on the palate there are gingersnaps dipped in thick-cut marmalade and runny caramels though the ginger flavor muscles its way to the fore eventually. Water promotes more candied peel before a spearmint conclusion. This is really enjoyable whisky for those lucky enough to get their hands on it. (30 bottles)Â Â£50
Timorous Beastie 46.8%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,59,This wee sleekit cow'rin tim'rous beastie is a blended malt of Highland whiskies from Douglas Laing the latest of their regional recipes to join Scallywag and Big Peat. Perfumed soaps in muslin bags dried sprigs of heather beeswax and Edinburgh rock give this an intriguing bouquet. Juicy: mandarins glow with green plums and Granny Smith apples. Ripe yellow fruits and spices mid-palate conclude with sweet malt and fading creaminess sweeping around the gums. Distinctive and laudable.Â Â£39
Timorous Beastie 10 year old 46.8%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,47,Soft and floral with perfumed lavender soap peach green apple and parma violets. It floats in the mouth dispensing flavors of sweet apple custard tangy tangerine hard candies green plum marshmallow and white pepper. Delicious and accomplished but there's an overlap here: it feels like the NAS version had a birthday rather than the arrival of a new member of the family. Â£35
The Lost Distillery Company Classic Selection Lossit 43%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,43,The stills ran cold in this lost Islay distillery at Ballygrant in the 1860s. Excitingly acrid smoke on the nose: like fireworks or the smoking muzzle of a rifle mingled with summer lemons and crunchy green pear. Poached pears in cream greengages and peppercorns meet a stealthy sour gooseberry takeover. Fades to a chalky sour fruit plateau before a chili heat finish.
Copper Dog 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,32,Named after the warehouseman's preferred piece of pilfering paraphernalia the 125 year old Craigellachie Hotel's Copper Dog bar now boasts its own whisky. It's an appealing blend of eight Speyside malts with honey warm toast pecan nut apple turnover fudge fingers and orange peel. Vanilla orange pith wood spice caramel and fresh apple develop into creamy nougat. Takes a while to come into focus then concludes with a spicy finish.
The Famous Grouse Malt Whisky 10 year old 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,30,For the past few years Famous Grouse vintage vatted malt has been produced but not sold here in the U.S. They were in the 10-12 year old age range. This version being introduced to the U.S. is a non-vintage expression and I don't think it really matters. What matters is its taste. Major components of The Famous Grouse blended whiskies have included The Macallan and Highland Park and there's no doubt these malts are providing some of the richness and flavor complexity in this new expression. The whisky is quite hefty with notes of juicy fruit toffee almonds heather and a wisp of vanilla and smoke. It is also very well balanced and quite a bargain for $30. 
Eades â€œDouble Maltâ€ Highland (Second Edition) 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,70,Consists of two whiskies: half 10 year old Clynelish (finished in Chateau Lafite casks) and half 10 year old Ben Nevis (finished in Grenache Blanc casks). The classic chewy nutty toffee notes of Ben Nevis are prominent throughout while Clynelish's spicy briny notes become more prominent mid-palate peaking on the finish. The two work well together with the brine and spice cutting through the thick toffee. Bright berried fruit (from the finishing) adds an additional dimension prominently throughout. Some oak resin kicks in on the finish to keep the whisky from becoming too sappy sweet.
â€œDouble Maltâ€ Speyside (Second Edition) 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,70,This â€œdouble maltâ€ contains 70% 12 year old Dufftown (finished in a Zinfandel cask) and 30% 15 year old Mortlach (finished in a Callejo cask). This is a rich fruity gripping broad-shouldered Speyside whisky. Richly sherried with thick layered sweetness as a foundation (honey caramel light toffee) along with ripe bramble golden raisin and pit fruit. Leather tobacco-tinged oak tannin finish.
Wemyss The Hive 12 year old 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,57,Wemyss has picked up where The Easy Drinking Whisky Company left off a few years back and are selling their mix of malt whiskies under a descriptive flavor name. This is the best the company has done so far. It is a delightfully soft fruity and dessert-like whisky with yes lashings of honeyed malt to make it a soft succulent treat of a whisky. Wemyss comes of age.  Â£36
Wemyss Malts The Hive 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,54,Having previously appeared in 8 and 12 year old versions Wemyss dropped the age statement from their easygoing honey-drenched dram. Fortunately the nose of light honey lavender heather and spring blossoms confirms that it's business as usual. Melon mango passion fruit and a deft touch of spice give this a sweet fruity profile. Gentle heat persists into the finish with honeyed sweetness. It's crying out for a perfect scoop of vanilla ice cream. Still a crowd pleaser. Â£37
Master of Malt Reference Series III 47.5%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,178,With the majority of the blend coming from older single malts this forms a counterpoint to I and II (see below). Toasted spices fennel black peppercorns cocoa malt loaf split orange peels and salted caramel invade the nose. The palate is a gluttony of chocolate. Beneath look for dried fruits macchiato peanut shells and some tannic bitterness as the older malts show their wares. It leaves a cocoa finish without the sweetness. A great concept for self-educating your palate.Â Â£106
That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt 54%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,76,Have you ever noticed how some distilleries never appear under independent labels? They say they put a teaspoon of whisky from another distillery in each barrel; no longer a single malt. Whether they really do who knows? So here is a blended malt with 99.99 percent of the whisky from one distillery. This has no peat and is sweet honeyed and rich with vanilla banana lime sherbet and tropical fruits. Almost certainly from Speysideâ€¦but where? Â£50
Darkness! (distilled at North British) 18 year old 50.4%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,111,This North British has been led astray; well subjected to three months' confinement in first-fill oloroso sherry wood. Such are the ways of Darkness! There's a savory nose of peppered filet mustard seed and tarragon. Interesting but not to everyone's taste. The creamy texture consists of evaporated milk strong caramel dark toffee and black currant granola though that savory character persists. Water pumps up the cream raspberry and cereal notes until it sees daylight becoming almost a breakfast whisky.Â Â£70
Wemyss Malts Velvet Fig 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,61,Who could refuse a blend of single malts wholly matured in oloroso sherry casks? They've perfectly bottled the aroma of molten tiffin: the chocolate cocoa biscuit raisin dried dates and walnut are all here. Sipping brings on chocolate coffee malt ginger nutmeg and dried fig. There's no slow reveal it pretty much lays its cards on the table immediately; rather than developing flavors they extinguish one by one leaving a finish of cocoa and maltiness. (6000 bottles)Â Â£40
Double Barrel Talisker/Craigellachie 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,49,We don't see very much Craigellachie as a single malt because most of it goes into blending and from that we might draw the conclusion that it's not particularly distinctive in its own right. If it plays a role in this mix it's a submissive one then because after a not altogether enticing nose that has gooseberry green salad and some prickly chili pepper the palate is all about a mouth-coating big pepper hit that stays long into the finish. â‚¬40
Auld Reekie 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,60,The old name for Edinburgh has been hijacked for use on this mix of Islay malts and appropriate it is. The creosote damp outbuilding and oily rope nose is distinctive and strong the peat pronounced in the taste though gooseberry green melon and a trace of kumquat are also in the mix and there's pepper in there too. But ultimately the peat holds out and brings up the finish. 
That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at North British) Batch 1 51.1%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,76,Custard creams lemon peel and clotted cream create easygoing aromas on this drop from the mighty Edinburgh grain distillery. The palate moves rapidly through flavors of lemon cake and lime zest to grapefruit sharpness and fresh pineapple reaching a plateau of sherbet and tangerine. Like a bulldog chewing a wasp there's lip-puckering sharpness throughout though it's judiciously dosed with sufficient sweetness to counterbalance it. A great introduction to the delights of the single grain category. (117 bottles)Â Â£48
The Lost Distillery Company Classic Selection Benachie 43%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,43,Benachie formerly known as Jericho was an Aberdeenshire distillery built southeast of Huntly that existed from 1822â€“1913. A dark amber dram with a nose of marmalade ground almond cherry lips and vanilla essence. Attractive but not overly aromatic. Cooked plums after a peppery rush begin an attenuated flavor journey exiting with a spicy finale.
The Famous Jubilee 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,39,A tribute this time from Edrington Group in the form of this one-off blend of The Famous Grouse. The sherried element seems to have been upped as it shows lavish amounts of dark chocolate black cherry and a little treacle with some orange peel and with water raspberry and heather.  The palate shows a hint of smoke and builds through rich flavors to a toffee-accented finish. Subtle and long. Â£25
Wild Scotsman 15 year old 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,85,Pleasingly aromatic and floral with lively fruit fresh cereal grain honey and vanilla cream. Subtle grassy hay notes add complexity. A very friendly whisky conjuring up images of a sunny afternoon in Spring. 
Eades Highland 'Double Malt' 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,70,A marriage of Ben Nevis (85%) and Clynelish (15%). A weighty whisky. Not as nimble as the Speyside expression below but with flavors that linger. Rummy toffee notes roasted nuts earthy moss jammy fruit teasingly subtle black strap molasses and clove. 
Wemyss Malts Spice King 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,54,This NAS version is a little smokier than before with ground pepper toasted coriander and fennel seeds and a dusting of nutmeg. The mouthfeel is light initially; early orange and lime flavors are extinguished quickly. Warm cocoa malt chocolate shavings black cherry raspberry bubblegum and concentrated dark fruits complement restrained spices and faint smoke followed by a hot spicy cinnamon finish. It's pretty decent but the palate doesn't quite match up to the promise of the nose. Â£37
Double Barrel Laphroaig/Mortlach 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,77,This is one of the more intriguing of the Double Barrel series because while the others either complement each other or don't this has a depth to it that you need to look for. At first it's all Laphroaig and the peat and sea burst out of the glass. But just as you're asking yourself what the point is the fruity notes of the Mortlach cushion the whole landing and let you down gently. Impressive. 
That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Loch Lomond) Batch 1 52.4%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,60,Rose petals pomegranate toasted coriander seeds and glacÃ© cherry mix it up with a tangle of Bramley apple peelings. A medium weight grain whisky with a satiny texture. Huge throbbing pulsating ginger kicks in at full strength. Yowser! Water knocks the fiery ginger out but quells this Loch Lomond to a duller spice profile. A finish of ground almond subdued gingerbread and active spices. Great nose but I was hoping for greater versatility of flavor.Â Â£38
Grand Macnish Six Cask Edition 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,37,Playing on regional styles this blends six single malts representative of the Speyside Islay Lowland Campbeltown Islands and Highland whisky regions. Sun-dried peats greet the nose with aromas of stewed apples flaky pastries apricot conserve vanilla and cinnamon. Creamy vanilla and coconut flavors develop with a slow-burn spiciness crackling in the center of the tongue. Seville orange and caramel cookie flavors escort a long finish of dry tingling spices though it could use a little more heft in the mouthfeel.
Eades Speyside 'Double Malt' 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,70,An equal marriage of Longmorn and Glen Moray whiskies. Quite a fruity adventure with zingy notes of bramble strawberry rhubarb sultana nectarine and plum. All this fruit sits on a bed of creamy vanilla malt (the Longmorn influence is quite evident) that coats the palate long after the finish.
Eades Islay 'Double Malt' 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,70,Consists of 60% Bowmore and 40% Caol Ila. Bold youthful and somewhat medicinal (as would be expected) with peat smoke tar pebbles on a beach and boat docks. Additional flavors of smoked olives and exotic pepper add intrigue while honeyed malt notes soothe the palate and provide balance.
Wemyss Vintage Malts 'The Peat Chimney' 8 year old 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,40,Aggressive earthy smoke tar fiery pepper bath soap and ginger tamed by toffee and ripe malt. Lingering smoldering peat anise and tobacco. For those who like smoky whiskies young aggressive and unabashed.
Wemyss Vintage Malts 'The Spice King' 8 year old 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,40,Nectarine tangerine toffee and vanilla on the nose. There's also teasing smoke if you look for it. The sweet fruity notes start at the beginning of the palate then cinnamon nutmeg cut hay and smoke kick in. Lingering cracked pepper clove and distant smoke. Good gritty texture. Dynamic stuff for a young whisky.
Wemyss The Peat Chimney 12 year old 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,55,The problem with selling your whisky by description is that if you don't deliver what you've claimed in the name you're in trouble. That's a little bit how it was with these whiskies when they were seven years old. At this age though these are big boy whiskies and there is plenty of peat seaweed oil barbecued fish and salty sea notes to keep you hooked. Nicely balanced with fruit too.  Â£35
Master of Malt Reference Series II 47.5%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,91,This laudable effort of comparative whiskies explores the effect of age by combining four parcels of stock in different proportions. The older whiskies produce an enticing nose of marmalade-encrusted ham on the bone grist and worn sandpaper. It's sugary sweet with ripe melon before the sherry takes control and dishes out cherry candy and papaya. Held in the mouth it develops layers of creamy latte and milk chocolate as the fruit fades. More to get your teeth into here.Â Â£54
The Exclusive Malts Blend of Malts 20 year old 1994 50%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,100,Whiskies from undisclosed Speyside and Highland distilleries are blended together in first-fill sherry butts. On the nose it's an alluring blend of orange cherry toffee salt and ginger. The entry follows the nose with toffee orange ginger and malt. Things begin to drop off in the mid-palate which is very focused on salt and ginger with strong alcohol undertones. The alcohol drives and defines a dry finish that's absent of much of what's so alluring about this whisky. (U.S. only)
Wemyss Malts (distilled at Aultmore) 20 year old 1982 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,81,155,Aultmore is part of the Dewar's stable and another of Speyside's forgotten light brigade. Here is a noseful of esters: bubblegum pineapple pink grapefruit strawberries and icing sugar. Visions of â€œLegally Blondeâ€ flash through the mind. The palate is equally energetic though with little cask influence it's a bit gawky and slightly green especially with water suggesting that another year wouldn't have done it any harm. Still all very lovely.  Â£100
The Annasach Reserve 25 year old 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,81,340,William Grant & Sons Rare Cask Reserves are micro-blends created jointly by Brian Kinsman and various liquor store proprietors drawing on a choice of over 40 different single malts (importantly not Glenfiddich or Balvenie). Quite herbal with tarragon cilantro boiled candies and unripe plums. A slow starter; vegetal notes yield to fudge milk chocolate orange and maltiness with pepper oak and spices in the latter phases. Stocked in only five U.S. retailers.
McDougall's Selection 13 year old 54.7%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,120,A blend of four different Islay malt whiskies. A pungent merciless Islay whisky with intense peat reek tarry rope and raw seaweed. Fiery cinnamon clove evergreen and unsweetened black licorice stick just adds fuel to the fire. An underbelly of vanilla malt and suggestions of coconut cream try to douse the fire but it's a losing battle. Long seemingly endless burning ember finish.
Cutty Sark Blended Malt 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,30,Remarkably light and drinkable for an all-malt product. Malty foundation with citrus (lemon zest tangerine sherbet) shining through along with vanilla wafer white chocolate coconut ginger and cut grass. A worthy â€œbridge whiskyâ€ for blended whisky drinkers curious about malt whisky but single malt whisky drinkers might want more individuality. A whisky for a warm lazy afternoon.
Wemyss The Spice King 12 Year Old 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,55,The least assertive of the Wemyss 12 year old range and the most flighty. There's nothing wrong here and the whisky's well-made and won't disappoint but when you compare the spice hit here with what's on offer with other malts this isn't shouting loudly enough. Â£35
Double Barrel Caol Ila/Tamdhu 46%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,49,The weakest of the Double Barrel trio on offer this has a slightly spirity nose with a somewhat unpleasant off note but the taste promises more than the nose delivers. The oily peaty Caol Ila is seemingly held in check by the Tamdhu on the one hand while the fresh zingy sherbet-like characteristics of Tamdhu are tantalizingly faint. In the end pepper and peat dominate.â‚¬40
That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Invergordon) Batch 2 58.3%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,114,Despite the high strength the aromas strike the nose like a pillow in slow motion. Greengages corn and ripening lemons lift from the glass. It's a thick unctuous layered mouthful with honey gooseberry and lemon acidity though a splash of water produces softer notes of Scottish tablet and evaporated milk. A little sourness in the finish. Sure part of the allure of Boutique-y whisky is the batch variations but this is quite a different beast from the magnificent Batch 1.Â Â£72
The Epicurean 46.2%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,44,This is the Lowland entry into Douglas Laing's Remarkable Regional Malts collection and on approach the nose is like sipping lemonade in a malt hopper: gristy malt lemon lime honeydew melon vanilla pods peach and apricot. A similarly juicy palate gaining sweet grassy notes Spangles and confectioners' sugar before ending on a finish of dried citrus and fizzy Refreshers. True to the region but the Epicurean makes the rest of the range look brighter quicker smarter and tastier in comparison. Â£34
Wemyss Vintage Malts 'The Smooth Gentleman' 8 year old 40%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,79,40,Indeed smooth and malty with vanilla shortbread golden raisin and macadamia nuts. Light oak spice emerges on a fairly quick finish. (It is only 8 years old after all.) Pleasant and easy-going.
That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt #2 (Batch 2) 43.1%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,78,144,Caramel wafers white pepper pumice stone and strands of caramel on the nose but this is not a whisky bursting with personality. A sip brings cocoa and chocolate flavors which meld into an herb garden bouquet. A thin mouthfeel and rather linear flavor development make this seem rather ordinary not a word I normally associate with this idiosyncratic range. The finish is redolent of marble cake. Not a patch on the superb Batch 1 in my book. (415 bottles) Â£100
Master of Malt Reference Series 47.5%,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,77,62,A predominantly young blended malt heads up the first of the Reference Series designed as an educational tool to help attune your palate. It's a light floral array with waxed lemons oatcakes and peppermint. Mouthfeel is thin with little structure heavy on the barley with hints of boiled fruit candies. Sipped neat it's drying with doughy notes and dried apple. Water fails to enliven the experience other than showing late lemon and icing sugar. Memorize it and move up.
Johnnie Walker Blue Label,Blended Scotch Whisky,97,225,"Magnificently powerful and intense. Caramels, dried peats, elegant cigar smoke, seeds scraped from vanilla beans, brand new pencils, peppercorn, coriander seeds, and star anise make for a deeply satisfying nosing experience. Silky caramels, bountiful fruits of ripe peach, stewed apple, orange pith, and pervasive smoke with elements of burnt tobacco. An abiding finish of smoke, dry spices, and banoffee pie sweetness. Close to perfection. Editor's Choice"
Compass Box The Peat Monster 10th Anniversary Special Cask Strength Bottling 54.7%,Blended Scotch Whisky,95,120,As you'd expect solid peat is the first thing out of the glass but this isn't just a peat beast. Underneath are honey dried fruit and malt. The palate is all about balance with honeyed malt raisin and oak spice all complementing smoky peat. A lush mouthfeel makes you forget it's cask strength. A pure love note in a glass from Compass Box to Park Avenue Liquor.Â  (Park Avenue Liquor only)
Johnnie Walker Blue Anniversary 60%,Blended Scotch Whisky,95,3500,Formulated to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Johnnie Walker. This is a fabulous whisky for anyone who can spring for the bottle. It is deep dark and quite powerful with a hefty malt foundation and sweeter notes of toffee and vanilla combined with resinous oak complex fruit (both bright citrus notes and darker pit fruits) crisp mint tobacco polished leather and heavy peat smoke. A tour de force of a blended scotch-as big as many single malts reviewed here. 
Chivas 18 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,95,70,An essay in balance on both the aroma and palate. Silky layers of delicate sweetness (honeyed vanilla caramel light toffee) permeate through clean delicate fruit (citrus peach currant) and subtle complex dried spice. Clean finish with a hint of dark chocolate. A very versatile very drinkable blend which suits most moods and occasions. Indeed a benchmark blended scotch. 
The Last Drop 1960 vintage 48 year old 52%,Blended Scotch Whisky,95,2000,A 12 year old blended whisky was created in 1972 consisting of 70 different malt whiskies and 12 grain whiskies.Â  The blend was then placed in three sherry casks where it was matured for the next 36 years (highly irregular to say the least).Â  The quality of the sherry casks is quite evident as is the whisky's age.Â  There's substantial malt content here too.Â  These three factors along with the wide range of malt and grain whiskies combine to create one of the finest blended Scotch whiskies I have ever tasted.Â  It's dark mysterious and enormously complex with notes of molasses fig cake dried fruit tobacco dark chocolate old pot still rum and polished leather finishing with lingering cinnamon and mint.Â  There's no sign of this whisky getting tired at all.Â  I am pleased they bottled it at natural strength and didn't water it down to 40% or 43% abv which could have ruined it.(Allocation information:Â  There's a total of 1.347 bottles of which only 350 are being imported to the U.S.Â  They are available exclusively at Binny's Beverage Depot (Chicago) Park Avenue Liquors (New York) and Wally's (Los Angeles)).
The Last Drop 50 year old 50.9%,Blended Scotch Whisky,95,4000,Would you have gambled The Last Drop 1960 liquid in new sherry wood for four more years? The indulgent nose proffers maple syrup buckwheat honey roasted spices blue grapes pomegranate raspberry compote cilantro pandan leaf and beefsteak juices soaking into mushroom gills. The complex lustrous mouthfeel is replete with a sheen of rich maltiness molasses lashed by sherry before a dry resinous finish. Water brings an oily nuttiness then further drops produce a silky clingy texture. Glorious. Miraculous. Victorious. (388 bottles only)
Compass Box Phenomenology 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,94,180,The nose has honey caramelized apples Pixy Stix pears in cream faint pepper ground coriander and salty driftwood. It's teeth-coating with golden syrup sugariness the silky texture meting out pears apples sweet barley notes and crunchy spices before a vanilla phase gives way to black pepper licorice and smoke. Mouth-numbing finish of long-active spices over vanilla. (7908 bottles)
Johnnie Walker The Casks Edition 55.8%,Blended Scotch Whisky,94,300,You don't mess with the Johnnie Walker brand name casually so we expect greatness and boy do we get it here. This has a dusty smoky nose with dried apricot and grape and the whisky is gossamer-soft on the palate with sweet pear and honey evolving on top of an oaky rich heart before a tidal wave of pepper and peat and a delightful spice smoke and oak conclusion. Magnificent. 
The John Walker 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,94,3500,The pinnacle of the current Johnnie Walker range this is a rare inimitable blend of just nine whiskies. It exudes the aromas of ripe bananitos whole mango satsuma vanilla seeds barley awns butter biscuits and crystallized pineapple. The supple grain sustains indulgent characterful malts creating a weighty smooth mouthfeel. I'm smitten by the vanilla creaminess burgeoning deep fruit layers how it swells with a satisfying snuffbox smokiness. A beautifully styled blend delivering a captivating sensuous experience. (330 bottles only)
Chivas Regal 18 year old Ultimate Cask Collection First Fill French Oak Finish 48%,Blended Scotch Whisky,94,120,An auld alliance renewed this gorgeous whisky packs spicy aromas of peppercorn star anise and cardamom seeds mingling with toffee squares plum jam dunnage earth and dried sprigs of heather. Rich fruitcake jellied fruit and bramble then spices course through the mouth: chili heat black pepper and raw ginger. Final phase has chocolate praline growing milky nutty and soothing. Exceptional lengthy finish with reignited spices. Chivas 18 goes electric. (Travel Retail exclusive)
The Antiquary 21 year old 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,94,100,Drier than the 12 year old (reviewed below) with some darker fruit (black raspberry blueberry) marrying with the brighter orchard fruit.Â  Sweet up front - honey and caramel - with a peppering of spice (dried vanilla clove and cinnamon) increasing as the palate develops.Â  Dry oak spice finish.Â  Lovely! 
Black Bull 30 year old 50%,Blended Scotch Whisky,94,200,Well what have we here? A blend of 50% malt and 50% grain (a very high malt content for a blend) and bottled at 50% too! The whisky was blended first (very unusual) before being aged in sherry casks for its entire life. Antique amber/chestnut color. Full sherry impact but never cloying -- the higher alcohol level and grain whisky cut through the sherry and add balance and drinkability. This is a fruity-confection delight with raisin chutney fig cake orange almond scone and chocolate-covered cherry. Add to the mix richly textured toffee old oak polished leather and a cinnamon-spiced tobacco finish. A rare treat! A great old blend that malt drinkers will embrace.
Black Bull 40 year old 7th release 47.6%,Blended Scotch Whisky,94,1400,Jaw-dropping: Aberlour 1973 Bunnahabhain 1968 and 1969 Bowmore 1968 Caperdonich 1972 Glen Grant 1974 Glenfarclas 1966 Glenlivet 1968 and 1970 Highland Park 1967 and 1970 and Macallan 1969. It includes a 14% grain content from Caledonian 1974 Carsebridge 1970 Girvan 1974 Invergordon 1972 Lochside 1966 North of Scotland 1974 and Port Dundas 1973. An elegant refined mÃ©lange of peach pear soft oak and rose cream florals with dark fruit chocolate and fine pepper. Outstanding.
Royal Salute 62 Gun Salute 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,94,3000,Named after the gun rounds fired on Royal anniversaries at the Tower of London. Heightened sherry tones with dark Madagascar chocolate Brazil nut fondant cream and faint espresso indulge the nose. One heavenly sip reveals a velvety smooth whisky thick and sticky all revolving around the chocolate and nut with a little support from dark fruits. You can chew over this for hours as the finish soft-pedals the main themes. A work of genius.
Compass Box The Double Single 2017 Release 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,93,175,Not seen since 2010 this yields vanilla frosting menthol spearmint cream dry spices cedarwood chopped herbs and a discernable whiff of old grain. Silky taste of butterscotch; it becomes more honeyed with creamy vanilla dried banana malt and a pinch of cinnamon pepper herbs clove and eucalyptus. The yin and yang of Glen Elgin and Girvan makes an admirable exercise in precision minimalist blending. Mad as a box of frogs.
Diamond Jubilee by John Walker & Sons 42.5%,Blended Scotch Whisky,93,157000,Bright gold. Amazingly fresh fruits and quince slowly evolving into mango blueberry and a jammy tayberry note. At the same time exotic spices like cardamom begin to build particularly when the surface is broken with a drop of water while vanilla pod notes develop. In the mouth the grain smooths all the elements giving an unctuous feel. There's just sufficient oakiness to give structure and any smoke is far in the distance.  A triumph of the blender's art. Â£100000
John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2016 Edition 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,93,850,Here's your private audience with the inestimable Mr. Beveridge. After contemplating impeccably selected aged liquids from the big five Distillers Company Limited (DCL) grain distilleries he's ready. Three vattings representing cask character distillery character and Highland single malt were combined in the final blend. Fresh layers of lemon and honey mingle with wood smoke. A seductive soft and creamy palate saturated with fudge and delicate vanilla fuse together in a study of honeyed perfection. A fine indulgence. The best yet. (8888 bottles)
Black Bottle 10 year old 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,93,34,Black Bottle is unique in that it combines seven different Islay whiskies with grain whisky. This produces a whisky with a beautifully rounded Islay character that will satisfy the discriminating â€œpeat-headâ€ the drinkability of a blended scotch and plenty of complexity. For a blend there's heft to the whisky. I enjoy the interplay between the peat smoke brine seaweed its firm malty foundation and pleasingly dry finish. 
Royal Salute Stone of Destiny 38 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,93,600,The last new Chivas release was the 25 year old several years back. To be honest I didn't like it as much as Chivas 18 year old. Those extra years contributed an additional dry oak influence which I felt was a bit too dominantâ€”especially on the finish. So you can imagine my concerns before tasting this 38 year old whisky. But this new Royal Salute has something to balance the dry oak that the 25 year old didn'tâ€”lush rich sweet sherry notes. It's quite fruity with toffee apple date nut cake fig molasses and golden raisin up front evolving to dried fruit pencil shavings tobacco and polished leather with subtle cinnamon and cocoa on the finish. My favorite of the entire Chivas line is the 18 year old (which I rated a 95) for its impeccable balance but this is still a very impressive whisky!
Dewar's 25 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,93,225,Aged for a quarter century and finished in Royal Brackla casks? Count me in. The nose is highly attractive; a rich maltiness unfolds with vanilla oak flapjacks whole almonds and gentle background spices. Smooth caramels chocolate orange and a cappuccino note create a thick weighty blend that melts gracefully into pools of darker chocolate. The mouth-coating finish has plain chocolate dry oak and coffee. Brilliant liquid: smoothness personified.
The Last Drop 50 year old Double Matured 51.8%,Blended Scotch Whisky,93,4500,TLD's sixth release captivates with dark caramel Brazil nut polished oak cacao scorched earth grilled field mushroom and roasted coffee bean aromas. To sip is to submit to a discombobulating whirl of cherry and jellied black fruits replete with old sherry characteristics replaced by an unctuous oily base torn asunder by seething spices of clove pepper and star anise. Ever-changing. Muted exit of dulled spice browning apple and eucalyptus. (898 bottles)
The Last Drop 1971 47.2%,Blended Scotch Whisky,93,4000,It's like someone just turned up the volume on flavor. Cherry fudge marshmallow vanilla pod ristretto luscious caramel almond-topped Dundee cake and wood spices. Dark oily and muscular with burnished orange clove licorice and burnt char. Sweetness brims over the tongue with apple pear and malted barley as it softens to a beautiful velvety texture. This whisky's great journey is over. The baked apricot instigates an eternal finish (1352 bottles 300 for the U.S.)
Cutty Sark 25 year old 45.7%,Blended Scotch Whisky,93,170,Well-structured and masculine with its rich malty backbone and mouth-coating fruit. Yet there's a silky seductive underbelly that's very compelling. Notes of sultana honey-drenched mandarin ripe peach thick toffee and anise with a peppering of spice throughout especially toward the finish where a hint of smoke emerges. The grain whisky enhances the blend's allure by cutting through the whisky's viscosity making it very more-ish. I love the combination of drinkability flavor complexity and balance in this blend. Very versatile. Single malt drinkers will thoroughly enjoy this experience. (Note: at this time this whisky is not sold in the U.S.)
Compass Box Great King Street New York Blend 45%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,75,The original Great King Street blend was all sweet lemon and spice. This is something else again. This is a gutsy urban wise guy of a whisky rich in peat with distinctive malty flavorsâ€”all in all closer to a malt than a blend. That's because of the high malt content and only the rounded edges and soft finish are gilded by grain. Some fruit and spice emerge through the peat but the smoke's what you rememberâ€”a master class in blending.
Compass Box This Is Not A Luxury Whisky 53.1%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,225,This surrealist Compass Box whisky mimics the dimensional challenges of Magritte's â€œCeci n'est pas une pipeâ€ by raising questions about the luxury pretensions of whisky. Is it the expense? Packaging? Good taste? Masquerading behind a green apple a bowler-hatted John Glaser smiles enigmatically. Sultanas charcoal smoke toffee chocolate sea salt and warm sherry tones. The alcohol rides with dense black cherry cacao nibs Colombian coffee and dark fruits. Trails of smoking fruitcake finish the experience. Above all buy and consume. (4992 bottles)
Compass Box The Circus 49%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,275,Ringmaster John Glaser's latest Big Top attraction: the nose juggles dark marmalade almonds sweet sherry dates and dried pineapple. Flavors swing like a trapeze between deep orange dried tropical fruits nuts and chocolate with the silky composure of a seal balancing a ball on its nose. Ridiculously smooth; if you're looking for burn try fire eating instead. Knife throwers accurately pinpoint the finish: fruit (thud) chocolate (thud) spice (THUD). In this manner Mr. G. will challenge the world! (2490 bottles)
Compass Box No Name 48.9%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,125,Peatheads listen up! Yes there's pine needles zested lemons honey sanded wood nutmeg and cinnamon within this Islay-dominated blend but it's the billowing peat smoke that makes this special. It reeks gloriously of stacked fish boxes and heavy braided ropes on the pier. The dark fruit baked lemons cherry clove and cooked plum face entanglement in a labyrinth of shadowy stygian smoke. You could get lost in here for hours. (15000 bottles)
John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2017 Edition 46.8%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,815,Closer to the heart of JW than its predecessors Mastery of Oak follows a methodically complicated maturation and blending regime. American oak characteristics singed cedar spills damson jam stewed apple and rhubarb laced with peppery spice nutmeg and clove. A dichotomy of flavors: toffee apple and rhubarb become piquant verging on sour with a parallel strand of honey and Caramac. Short finish of the last vestiges of fruit and spice. (5588 bottles U.S. Travel Retail)
Johnnie Walker Blenders' Batch No. 2 Bourbon Cask and Rye Finish 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,53,Try this in your next Manhattan. Heather honey sweetness Belgian waffles cinnamon rye spices creamy vanilla peppercorn and dried porcini emerge after the 6-month rye cask finishing period. Sweet caramel oozes over the tongue Highland toffee and Orkney fudge hold the spices in check. Banana candy and deep citrus acknowledge the Dufftown single malt component. The most accomplished Blender's Batch to date. Emma Walker has nailed it. (Travel Retail exclusive)
Chivas Regal 18 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,99,It rarely gets better than this. Vanilla almond slice toffee pencil shavings sweet oak and mild wood spices on the nose. Effortlessly smooth and delicate this warms up gradually with malt dark fudge leather raisin and tobacco notes before the wood spices oak and chocolate take center stage ending with a warm lengthy finish. This must be master blender Colin Scott's most preciously guarded recipe. The man's a genius!
Chivas Regal 18 year old Ultimate Cask Collection First Fill American Oak Finish 48%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,120,And you thought all Chivas Regal 18 year old was the same. Luscious toffee cinnamon nutmeg chocolate praline dry grasses hazelnut and just a lift of lime and peppermint. The palate has fudge-like sweetness caramel walnut cake murmuring spices orange peel and toffee banana. Water unlocks watermelon and a fruitier side to its character. The spices push hard through the finish as the toffee flavors relinquish their grip.
Dewar's Signature 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,200,Johnnie Walker Blue meet Dewar's Signature. Signature is Dewar's introduction into the ultra-premium blended scotch category. Like Johnnie Walker Blue Signature bears no age statement but I'm told that a 27 year old Aberfeldy is the heart of the blend. The first release consists only of 1000 individually numbered bottles and they're only available in New York City. I'm always a little skeptical of very expensive blends that come in fancy packages. There are some very good reasonably priced blends in the 10-20 year old range and the expensive ones are often only marginally better if that. But I like this whisky a whole lot better than the standard Dewar's White Label and it is also superior to Dewar's 12 year old-a whisky which I find to be quite enjoyable. While maintaining the Dewar's profile-nicely balanced-this whisky offers greater depth maturity and complexity without being too woody-a creamy malty foundation makes sure of that. The whisky expresses a rich honeyed maltiness which combines nicely with notes of golden raisins vanilla caramel and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e with just a hint of spicy oak notes for complexity. Signature is a different style when compared to Johnnie Walker Blue-it's more elegant and bashful-but like Blue I put Signature on my short list of the finest blends on the market. 
Black Bull 40 year old 40.2%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,250,A whopping 90% malt and 10% grain whisky. Soft with the oak remarkably restrained for its age. Soothingly sweet with toffee apple vanilla-spiked sponge cake nougat butterscotch sultana and cut grass. A dash of cinnamon and coconut throughout with teasing gentle polished oak on the finish. Deftly balanced and oh so drinkable. 
Mackinlay's Rare Old Highland whisky 47.3%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,162,Rarely has a blend caused as much excitement as this one but with good reason. This is also known as the Shackleton whisky and is a recreation of the whisky abandoned in the Antarctic by explorer Ernest Shackleton more than 100 years ago. It has lemon spring blossom and wafts of smoke on the nose. The taste is full and citrusy with peat and pepper in attendance. Beautifully balanced and outstanding but there are just 50000 bottles so snap it up.
Ballantine's 21 year old Signature Oak Edition 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,140,Sandy Hyslop has excelled at solely blending European oak sherry cask whiskies here. A dry spicy nose to relish: rum-raisin ice cream wafer biscuits fennel seeds roasted coriander seasoned oak and dense fruitcake. After the Cinnamon Toast Crunch and toffee sweetness disrobe a riot of spices cavorts across the tastebuds bedding down to a flavor of spiced chocolate-covered toffee bars. For cigar lovers this demands a fine robust smoke. (Travel Retail exclusive)
William Grant Rare Cask Reserves Ghosted Reserve 21 year old 42.8%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,140,A purity and fragility rarely encountered with aromas as fleeting as footprints on wet sand: marshmallow meringue honey and rose petals. A delicacy to the structure brings banana caramel spun sugar and orange peel. The oak spices build slowly making the lips throb from the inside. It's an elaborate maze of ethereal suggestion and an apparition of calm beauty. It atrophies reluctantly leaving tangy peels and lengthy sweetness anchored by spicy base notes. (12000 bottles)
Pure Scot Virgin Oak 43 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,92,50,Bladnoch master distiller Ian MacMillan's blend is worth seeking out for its appealing freshness; green apple caramel shaved oak toasted whole-grain bread warm pastries and dried peels. The palate is awash with bright flavors of honey walnut barley sugar gingerbread in custard orange taffy candy and a little spice. It squeezes out more juicy peel oils the more you taste. The conclusion has sweet honey gingerbread crumbs and a citrus intensity.
Compass Box Great King Street Artist's Blend 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,45,After a series of esoteric and expensive releases Compass Box has decided to bring it all back to the people with a blend â€” and how! The journey sets out as we might expect; all sweet vanilla ice cream stewed pear tart and peach melba but then a wave of spice and white pepper provides an unexpected but delightful twist. It's like Spice Tree meets Hedonismâ€¦Spiconism if you like.
John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2014 Edition 46.8%,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,840,Smoke begins Jim Beveridge's public replication of the annual Directors Blend concept built around Johnnie Walker's signature characteristics. Peat smoke harks back to Islay but there's wood smoke tobacco leaf and malt with a salty richness behind it. The grain just gives it a lift of extra sweetness. Polished with great structure; red apple raspberry and sweet linctus wrap up with a long smoky finish of cigar stub and peat stores. Clear parallels with Directors Blend 2009 but better. (8888 decanters released)Â Â£500
Johnnie Walker Blue Label Ghost and Rare 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,400,This is much more muscular than the regular un-haunted Blue Label. It delivers a multitude of flavorsâ€”butter toffee sweet smoke citrus peel and dry spicesâ€”tantalizingly peeling off layer after layer building a slow crescendo to a peak of spices and bitter citrus. Mouth drawing with caramel apple pear and sherbet a mid-palate of zesty orange and baking spices before topping out with bitter peels grapefruit smoke and sour hard candy.
Dewar's Founder's Reserve 18 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,80,Available for several years but now finally making its debut in the U.S. The higher-end Dewar's expressions (Dewar's 12 year old and Dewar's Signature) are very good blends. This one is situated smartly between the two. The malt proportion is rich and creamy; the grain whisky is crisp and well-integrated. Antique gold color with notes of butterscotch vanilla wafer strawberry rhubarb pie and citrus drizzled with honey. Lovely floral notes in the aroma along with a pleasing dried spice finish. I could drink this stuff all day long!
Dewar's 30 year old Ne Plus Ultra 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,499,This Pedro XimÃ©nez-finished blend is the oldest Dewar's expression available. It offers a deliciously deep nose of chocolate-dipped biscuits dried fruits and orange peel. The palate includes indulgent rewards of berry fruit chocolate praline raspberry cherry dried cranberry and hazelnut. It remains succulent throughout the sherry fruit keeping the upper hand over the chocolate and batting away the occasional coffee note. A dry finish with nutty chocolate and roasted spice. (Global Travel Retail only)
Classic Cask 23 year old Original Cask 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,160,This archetypal midnight dram enthralls with aromas of cedar wood humidor blossom honey hazelnut vanilla pod treacle cake and maple syrup. Dry as leaves save for some floaty florals. It's less weighty than some whiskies at this age with a balanced show of cinnamon cocoa berry fruits dried grapefruit hard peel wood spices dark toffee and oak. A finish of dark vanilla oak spice and leather make for a fine digestif. (782 bottles)
The Last Drop 1965 Blend 48 year old 48.6%,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,4000,Originally blended then recasked into fresh bourbon wood three decades ago the nose of ripened peaches cooked pear pecan nuts menthol clove and vanilla make for a compelling combination. A surprising lift of red summer fruits as this bright whisky sashays around the mouth the complexity measured out in installments; plum sauce toasted oak coffee bean gingersnaps clove licorice and hints of savory juices. It dances on and on with the whirling wood spices in no hurry whatsoever. (592 bottles)
Ballantine's 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions â€“ Scapa 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,80,As you raise the glass to your nose this has refreshment written all over it. The fragrance of an early morning visit to a florist zesty orange notes honey peach pits a hint of salt and the faintest trace of smoke. It's silky smooth glistening with honey a firm edge of orange vanilla tablet barley sugar powdered ginger all elevated by the grains supporting the Scapa. A smooth feather-light finish of sparkling light spices and creaminess. A joy to behold.
That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky #1 35 year old (batch 3) 46.5%,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,150,This dark chestnut liquid exudes wafts of rose hip dense fruitcake sliced fig cherry oak Brazil nut and earthy fragrant damp moss within the rich sherry complexity. A voluptuous palate-saturating whisky with burnt orange ginger spices star anise dried fig and ripe purple plums concluding with chocolate truffles. It's a rollicking good blend dripping with sherry notes and leaves a deep glow far back in the palate. You're going to love it. (1428 bottles)Â Â£120
Royal Salute Special Batch 21 year old Polo Edition 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,145,A pedigree blend gracing your glass with aromas of sultana prune glacÃ© cherry toffee nutmeg dense dark fruits sweet toffee and cozy Christmas spices. This well-paced silky blend canters through red apple cherry pomegranate pressed date bars Brazil nut nutmeg and pepper. Cinnamon black pepper and apple peel make for a harmonious finish. A suitably glamorous libation for spectators of the sport of kings. Â£110
Buchanan's Red Seal 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,169,Inhale deeply and this bestows a sense of serenity; morning dew on clipped lawns strewn with spent fireworks and strands of honey mingled with subtle elegant smoke. Blender Maureen Robinson's light well-balanced creation ushers in gentle honey and growing sweetness before billowing puffs of smoke grow dominant. Charred peaks of a lemon meringue pie iced coffee and milk chocolate follow leaving a catch of smoke in the aftertaste. Quite a charmer.
Alexander Murray & Co. The Monumental 18 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,65,Sweet caramel on the boundary of maple syrup flavors with aging tobacco leaf walnuts malted barley charcoal sticks and snuffed candle wicks all cushioned by soft oak. An initial impression of a lighter character though it's bursting with juicy toffee butterscotch sauce wood spices and dried banana. The spices vibrate gently around the gums on the dry finish of this high-malt content blend leaving nutty residual flavors.
Compass Box Delilah's 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,65,A special bottling in recognition of Chicago's outstanding alternative rock venue Delilah's and like that venue this is full of character color grit and determination. It's sweet but never cloying soft and honeyed but gutsy and there are peppermint licorice and fresh hay notes in the mix too. It's spent time in bourbon wood and that shows. A departure for Compass Box but a healthy one.
Compass Box The Peat Monster 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,60,A fantastically earthy whisky bristling with real grubby peat: more blazing bothy peat fire than coastal campfire. Fleeting elements of fudge and smoldering mellow cigar stubs. A smooth creamy blend with lemon curd vanilla sponge mint smoked prosciutto and a dollop of malt. There's wonderfully smoky singeing heat at the back of the palate though it feels like the Islay peat has been pegged back for the 2015 batch. A succulent and smoky finish to warm the soul.
Johnnie Walker Double Black 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,40,So how brave can you be? Would you take one of the world's most iconic blends and risk messing with it? If you've got a whisky maker as good as Jim Beveridge then why not? This picks up from the regular JW Black and its signature Caol Ila smoke and peat heart and then adds to it doing exactly what it says on the tin. But the clever part of this is upping the apple orange and fruit content too. Great. 
Johnnie Walker Blenders' Batch No. 3 Triple Grain American Oak 10 year old 41.3%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,30,Wheat corn and malted barley are your three grains here. Orange grove before harvest a rounded candied peel note plenty of sweet grain and creamy vanilla all backed by gentle spice. Luscious and chewy caramel taffy candy lavishly rich orange and glowing spice notes wrap around the tongue. It's incredible how they can make this tasty blend of five whiskies look so devastatingly easy (when it's not). Value Pick
Royal Salute 21 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,170,Not exactly a new whisky for the Jubilee just a new pack but it's a good enough excuse to have a look at this top-end blend. Great maturity with masses of orchard fruits and a hint of passion fruit as well. The oak is rounded and supple while with water a banana note is released. Thick and chewy with more grip than suggested on the nose and a little nut on the finish. Great blending. 
Dewar's 15 year old The Monarch 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,50,The divine stone fruit aromas are the key to unlocking the nose on this one: apricot honey vanilla icing malt bins Quaker Oats Squares and lofty floral top notes. Sweet mandarin brown sugar vanilla fudge strands of finely shredded peel and more spice than the 12 year old can muster. The sweet vanilla aftertaste is softer and more elegant than the younger expressions.
King's Crest 25 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,125,Amber gold color. Aromas of delicate fruit coconut vanilla and toffee with delicate background oak notes. The flavor delivers what the aroma promises. It is nicely balanced with a lingering dryish finish. 
Cutty Sark Prohibition 50%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,30,The Real McCoy! It's said that during Prohibition Bill McCoy serviced the better speakeasies with proper Cutty Sark; hence the name. If this is a recreation of what they might have been drinking back then you can see why they kept fighting over it. This is another bold earthy smoky blend with oily industrial notes. There's crabapple smoke bitter lemon grapefruit and even black currant. It would seem blended whisky is where it's at right now! Great stuff.  
Cutty Sark Art Deco Limited Edition 33 year old 41.7%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,989,Imagine sipping this sophisticated libation at the supper club turned out in your best bib and tucker.

Ballantine's Limited 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,229,If Willy Wonka was ever inclined to condense a knickerbocker glory into a dram it would nose and taste like this: caramel toffee hints of cocoa peeled banana chewy marshmallows cream and gooey fudge sauce. The palate has banana slightly burnt caramel poached pear and Banoffee pie layered over mixed peel flavors adding to its delicious appeal. It's sweet dry smooth and comforting like that final satisfying mouthful drained from a mug of hot chocolate. Comfort food for thirsty people.
House of Hazelwood 25 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,150,Toasty granola rye crackers barley sugar sweetness and Murray Mints make for a balanced nose on this top-of-the-range blend representing the art deco elegance of 1920s Shanghai. A gloriously thick texture of rich citrus blossoms bolstered by toffee lime pineapple tropical fruits and vanilla sugar. Mr. Kinsman has engineered methodical and well-paced complexity here with emergent little lights of spiciness. A long-lasting deep orange buzz and dimming spice round off proceedings. A precious joy indeed. Â£115 Travel Retail exclusive
 That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky No.1 50 year old 46.6%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,200,Ovaltine Whoppers worn leather antique furniture medjool dates and black fruits on the nose. Sipping this whisky is an unexpected delight. Given the olfactory cues of advanced maturity it's surprisingly nimble and still light on its toes. A charming opening of crumble filling with red currant cranberry raspberry and strawberry joined by apple pear and sultana with peppery spice. Chili heat and spicy finish. (Batch 6; 2000 bottles)
The Lost Distilleries Blend (Batch Four) 50.9%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,587,An enticing blend of aged single malt and grain whiskies from silent stills top-dressed with Port Ellen. The nose has soft fudge rosehip and honey lozenges with a thread of peat sewn through it. A distinct smokiness hangs above the glass. A mouthful exudes lemon sherbet honey-drizzled melon and white chocolate peaking with raspberry and mixed peel before a conclusion of banana-layered banoffee pie. An elegant finish of baked lemon and sweet oak. One for reflection.Â Â£350
SIA 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,50,This Kickstarter-funded blend is a very savvy and seamless mix of 40% malt and 60% grain whiskies. Pale gold in color the nose is inviting with dried apricot honey tangerine and salt. Everything from the nose comes together on the palate which is soft and sweet with the right amount of oak and smoke to balance everything out. There's a dash of heat and a solid finish. Who'd ever expect such a smart and affable whisky to come from Kickstarter? (U.S. only)
Alexander Murray & Co. The Monumental 30 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,140,Sherry finishing influences from leather satchel maraschino cherry floral blossoms and deep orange notes to a pinch of Chinese Five Spice and buttered ginger loaf. Medium bodied with a malt content of 75% it riffs around an orange theme at times quite sharp with pith some bitter grapefruit more ginger and herbal strands. Lively spices flicker across the tongue throughout the long finish as the citrus seeps away.
Compass Box The Peat Monster Cask Strength Magnum 57.3%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,188,Dry peats tossed on a driftwood fire with coastal aromas of sun-scorched seaweed beside high tide rock pools comprise this refined dram. A momentary glimpse of lighter lemon lime and pineapple is quickly snuffed out by the full strength assault. It's like pulling the pin on a grenade. There's a dense barrage of peat moss worn leather and cocoa at the death. Ride through it to glory. Possibly the highest ABV that Compass Box has ever given us.Â Â£120
Compass Box Asyla 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,60,This radiant refreshing whisky offers creamy fudge light vanilla fresh apple peach and biscuit notes on the nose demonstrating the generosity of the American oak. In the mouth it's luscious balanced and mouth-coating with sweet honey lemon peel lime zest and aromatic spices fattening out briefly before becoming soft as suede riffing on vanilla melon and lemon biscuits. Dry finish with vanilla cream and soft fruits.
Johnnie Walker Select Cask Rye Cask Finish 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,45,A zeitgeist Johnnie Walker fine-tuned for the American palate this blend has a moreish nose of cinnamon cocoa and the toasted coconut of macaroons mingled with strands of smoke dried walnut nutmeg and an array of spicy rye anchored by a concentrated line of vanilla. Lots of American oak at play here. It's elegant dry and smooth with vanilla cinnamon coconut and flashes of spice. It's fabulous sipped straight up but keep walking to the finish. Value Pick.
Johnnie Walker Blenders' Batch Sherry Cask Finish 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,44,Blender AimÃ©e Gibson's experimental batch 7 is designed as a sherry finished Black Label. Beautifully smoky with dried fruits charred oak wood spices vanilla cocoa and bonfire smoke. Toffee flavors with thick smoke red fruits orange raisin oak spice gingerbread marshmallow strawberry jam and dark marmalade. Dry finish with bitter peels dark chocolate and some feisty spices. In comparison regular Black Label is silkier more integrated and more peppery. (Global Travel Retail only)
Dewar's Special Reserve 12 year old 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,32,Gold-amber color. Toffee fruit and a wisp of smoke underpin floral aromas. On the palate flavors are nicely balanced and harmoniously interwoven. Gently sweet toffee notes up front gradually yield to drier notes on the finish with soft delicate fruit flavors throughout. 
Dewar's 12 year old The Ancestor 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,33,A straightforward proposition of honey vanilla sponge cake barley notes hints of apple fresh banana melon and bundles of dry straw. It's a sweetheart: soft vanilla fudge heather honey banana-topped banoffee pie fudge vanilla sandwich cookies barley sugar and lemon peel with hardly any spice in the early phase. The finish has a snag of pepper at the end but this is gorgeously tasty with smooth vanilla fudge all the way.
Classic Cask 23 year old Port Pipe 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,160,Maraschino cherries red currant oak bark and wet slate on the nose after 6 months of finishing. Light clean opening with cherry and strawberry; a little fig and raisin bring depth. Hints of clove and aniseed dart about then more oak swells up though the red fruity sweetness stays in control. A smooth finish of fruit chews with those spices burning brightly deep in the back of the throat. (769 bottles)
Cutty Sark 18 year old 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,80,Cutty Sark lost its way in recent years; expect that to change soon. Its owners have plans to return it to glory (and to include a 30 year old among its expressions â€” you read it here first). For the time being â€” if you can find it â€” this 18 year old is a sublime mix of soft plum and peach sweet pure grain easy-drinking vanilla and a deft oakiness all delivered in gentle and harmonious fashion. Masterful blending.
Cutty Sark Cask Strength 51.4%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,53,Blended whiskies have taken a sexy turn for the better and there have been some excellent attempts to innovate. Indeed a gap has opened up between main label blends and this sort of thing which is particularly brave because a world-class brand has let amateurs loose on it. That said this is massive with big earthy spice peat and sour fruits. There's some youthful sappiness in the mix too but it's not detrimental. Brave and impressive.  
Black Bull 12 year old 50%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,50,Quite rich and chewy with nutty toffee vanilla fudge nougat chocolate cake orchard fruit and black cherryâ€”all on a solid malty foundation. This isn't one of those elegant lighter-flavored blends with a high grain whisky content. The focus here is on fullness of flavor. A blend for the malt whisky drinker (but should also appeal to the more open-minded blend drinker too).
The Naked Grouse 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,35,This is the latest spinoff from core blend The Famous Grouse so there's Macallan and Highland Park in here and from the taste of it in sizeable quantities. With smart but minimalist packaging and an environmental theme this is a very â€˜now' whisky. It's heavily sherried very rich and sweet but there's enough spice to stop it becoming cloying and it's as soft as a down feather blanket on the palate. You can easily drink it straight too.  
Ballantine's 30 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,380,The nose unravels with milk chocolate thick hazelnut spread and a slender twist of orange peel though that delectable goodness is evenly balanced with peppermint patties and detectable light floral top notes. This has a lush softness with a perceptibly slow crescendo of flavors incorporating caramel toffee popcorn and chocolate praline. It's beautifully integrated with a smooth dense texture and releases its grip reluctantly with just a whisper of a peppermint reprise.
Ballantine's 17 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,69,Malt biscuits runny caramel blended black tea melting butter sliding across a hot skillet the leather uppers on new Oxfords and a more enjoyable waft of peat smoke than expected. Clean light flavors; lime jelly root ginger initially not overly sweet then a boost of honey caramelized fruits with toffee and cocoa later still. It's pricked with hints of smoke throughout with a long finish of pepper and other spices. Perfectly enjoyable anytime.
That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky No.1 50 year old (batch 5) 46.6%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,190,Here's one in the eye for people who grumble about high prices for age statement whisky. Sherry aromas good-quality plain chocolate clove-studded oranges coffee beans and fat sultanas. Thick gloopy texture with lashings of sherry mouth-drawing tannins a pleasant buzz of wood spices peppery chocolate and coffee dregs. It emerges from a savory middle section to a burnt orange salvation followed by a hot oaky finish. Â£148
The Tweeddale 12 year old Batch 3 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,68,Alasdair Day is on a mission to build a new Lowland distillery in the Borders of Scotland. While we wait the next batch from his grandfather's cellar book is a pale golden dram with a delectable nose of lemon meringue pie spring blossoms peach pit candy floss and Valrhona Ivoire white chocolate. This is more-ish whisky: like spooning into panna cotta. Pear syrup white chocolate and a sizzle of toasted muffins dissipate into a mild ginger and gooseberry finish.Â Â£40
The Golden Age Blend 44.3%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,503,Take a parcel of Macallan Glenrothes and Tamdhu all aged over 40 years season lightly with gently peated Bunnahabhain and North British grain whisky and what do you get? Golden sultanas linseed oil orange blossom honey butterscotch drying nuttiness and cedarwood. Blending has beneficially enhanced the three sherry-casked malts. It's juicy and sticky rhubarb and damson jams oak tannins and a little burnt note as the power swells. Cocoa chocolate and lingering oak to finish. (210 bottles) Â£350
The Half Century Blend 45.5%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,749,This is how to age gracefully. A remarkable decadent drop released to follow the success of the Golden Age blend this delivers heather honey tangerine juice banana chips dried apricots and sanded oak. It's a whisky of big expansive flavors. Citrus strands candied peel neroli and dried mango swirl amidst a syrupy mouthfeel steadily becoming creamier as it squeezes out yet more flavor. Dry oaky finish with residual fruit coffee beans and pleasingly bitter oak tannins that tingle the gums.Â Â£600
Buchanan's Special Reserve 18 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,90,This blend has style. Coils of red apple peel ripe orange cherry blossom florals freshly split oak and dry gentle spices like running a wet finger around an old spice jar. It's juicy and thick with festive satsumas some bright sharpness and acidic citrus overcome by juicy sweetness marmalade flavors and walnut. The refined finish has a tangle of spice orange peel honey and just a whiff of struck match.
J. Mossman Pink Gold Crown 18 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,89,68,On safe territory here with neroli oil caramel roasted spices surly peat smoke and just enough fruity sweetness to stay in the good books. Weightier than the 15 year old with more aged whisky characteristics: bright clementine dried citrus wheels and clove but after an eruption of smoke it fades to pineapple fermenting fruits and a prickly grapefruit acidity. The ashy embers on the finish retreat quickly.
Compass Box Asyla 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,38,Gold color. Floral aromas balanced with a gentle vanilla sweetness and soft fruit. Soft rounded body. The palate delivers what the aroma promises in a very clean and balanced way. Pleasing finish. 
Compass Box Great King Street Glasgow Blend 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,45,A ripe proposition the fruit and the smoke locked tightly together like interwoven fingers. Peaches melon baked apple fresh mango and sugar strands with a supporting role of red berries. With a malt content exceeding two-thirds the full-bodied palate is sweet as brown sugar with mandarin tartness apple and red licorice meandering to a vinous finish of red berry fruit. With its cheeky Glasgow landmark on the label this permanent addition to the GKS range is pure gallus.
Johnnie Walker Black Label 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,30,Need you ask? An unmistakable classic and an exemplar of a blended Scotch whisky famous around the world. Toffee swirling caramel whole almond and mashed banana amid twisting white smoke. The palate has such poise balance and dexterity that it sets the standard for many less accomplished blends to aspire to. Conspicuously iconic and the closest thing you will find to a complete whisky at this price.
Johnnie Walker Black Label The Director's Cut 49%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,80,A futuristic bottle design released for Ridley Scott's replicant sequel set in 2049 hence the punchy bottling strength. Peat smoke toffee caramels fresh banana and sliced red apple. Promising layers of fruit salad grape apple citrus and apricot are swept aside by an aggressive peppery attack emerging to notes of bitter fruit burnt rubber and smoke. If this is a glimpse of the future I'm stockpiling regular Black Label now. (39000 bottles)
Chivas Regal 25 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,300,A polished nose of red apple cinnamon caramels and salted almonds makes for an enticing prospect on this showpiece dram. The taste exemplifies smoothness. The indulgent palate comprises dark cooked fruits coffee malty cocoa sticky toffee pudding fudge and a fine line of orange. Roll it around the mouth: the integrated aged grains enable these select malts to achieve their full flavor potential. An exceptionally long finish has remnants of that toffee pudding and a well-sucked aniseed ball. Treat yourself.
Classic Cask 23 year old Caribbean Rum Barrels 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,160,I'm reminded of leafy ferns in spring sweet melon green bananas fresh cream and a dusting of spice when I nose this blend. A light green fruit taste of white grape and melon overlaid with runny toffee and banana before the impression of thick fruit skins becoming slightly tannic. Light spices and pepper follow with a finish of apple core and rich spice. (760 bottles)
Black Bull 21 year old 50%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,160,Thick orange peels grapefruit lime zest and Starburst taffy candies keep the nose of this premium expression within the purview of the Black Bull character. Layers of vanilla custard mellow fruit and ginger snaps quench an initial rush of sharp citrus. Sponge cake creaminess abounds though the spices nibble at the edges leaving a long sweet citrus finish. Water nips the more acidic elements while leaving the citrus flavors intact.
Black Grouse Alpha Edition 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,41,Arguably the most successful of the Famous Grouse extensions (well the competition includes Snow Grouse for Pete's sake!) the Black Grouse brought ever-popular peat into the mix a move that was followed by a peatier version of Johnnie Walker Black Label. The label says this is richer and peatier and it is. But this scores most for a chicory/coffee and liquid licorice undercarpet that makes it very palatable indeed. Neat over ice. (Travel Retail exclusive)â‚¬33
Ballantine's Christmas Reserve 2011 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,37,Master blender Sandy Hyslop has deliberately attempted to capture Christmas in the glass and so it should come as no surprise to find a rich full and flavorsome whisky with sherry trifle red berries orange fruit and mince pie filling in the mix. It's put together with grace and style mixes well and is that rare beast â€” a blend that can be enjoyed on its own.  
Ballantine's 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions â€“ Glenburgie 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,80,Up close this displays more sherry and dried fruits particularly raisins currants and sultanas with a deep strawberry note and dollop of marmalade. Quite pungent and that resonates rewardingly at the back of the throat. The juicy mandarin flavor has some tartness but then there's cake mix gingersnaps clove and toasted spices though it gravitates back to the marmalade. The finish has dry bitter orange ginger and spice with a hint of lime zest. Confident and characterful.
Ballantine's 21 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,139,Baked almond desserts liberally splashed with cream light caramel malted milk and an invading cloud of smoke from newly ignited twigs: a lucky strike from a forest survivalist. On the palate it is soft and blushing with marmalade and warm butter ground ginger moving to chocolate orange toffee and Ovaltine. A whirl of spices and chunky chocolate round off this blend's finish stylishly. This has all the hallmarks of a perfect nightcap.
William Grant's 25 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,294,I was surprised to find that Grant's blends were noticeable by their absence in the U.S. But with the purchase of Tuthilltown in New York and Tullamore Dew in Ireland that is slowly changing; and here's proof. Beautiful honeyed rich but the 40% ABV makes it the whisky equivalent of a radio DJ cutting off â€œFreebirdâ€ before the solo at the end. Still great and indeed better than most competition but not the classic it could be.
House of Hazelwood 18 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,65,The style and class of the youngest was inspired by the classic elegance of Paris in the 1920s. Comprising Kininvie and Girvan married in tuns of Portuguese oak this is pure creamy goodness bathing in lemon meringue pie vanilla tablet and fresh oak shavings. A buttery-soft texture the back of the palate kicks off with honey explosions nougat and toffee backed with a distinct oakiness to remind you that it's got much more to offer than just vanilla playfulness. Â£50 Travel Retail exclusive
That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky #1 50.3%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,91,A smashing rich sherry nose showcases rosehip elderberry scorched oak pipe tobacco roasted coriander seeds and damp dunnage warehouses. The core of the flavor is the lush orange jelly hidden in McVitie's Jaffa cakes combined with clove malt treacle dried mango and ginger. Water draws out stronger performances from the malty notes together with some red berry characteristics. Let it roll around the mouth it's terrific stuff (Batch 1 148 bottles).Â Â£57
That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky No.1 35 year old 46.5%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,150,Lighter in character than the 50 year old batch 4 offers aromas of caramel artisanal chocolate red fruits polished brogues and a fluttering of Asian spices. It has plenty of personality with molasses chocolate treacle cake date fig bramble and black currant though those spices return and then it gets rather woody. A sprightly older blend but beginning to show its age. (1428 bottles)
Te Bheag Blended Whisky 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,40,Pronounced â€œTe Vegâ€ this has its roots in the Isle of Skye and as there's only one distillery there it's highly likely that the odd drop of Talisker has found its way into the mix. Whether it has or not this is stirring stuff non-chill filtered so that the flavors burst forth. As you might expect it's rugged with brine and chili giving it a distinctive spice edge. But the delivery is a caramel fudge delight with luxury chocolate praline in there too.
The Exclusive Blend 35 year old 1980 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,200,If you like sherried malts you'll love this! Bottled at a respectable strength too. Red apple cherry skins strawberry raspberry Eccles cake malt loaf and warming spices; there's a lot to get your nose into here. A finely structured dram with soft leather rhubarb Bramley apple cherryade fresh Victoria plum pepper and muted ginger deliver sustained flavors. A long spicy and peeled fruit finish. Given the distillery closures in 1983 there could be some interesting components in here. (464 bottles)
Label 5 Extra Rare 18 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,62,Rather elegant blend with aromas of woodworker's bench salted cashew and dried banana chips all backed by gentle bonfire smoke. Creamy caramel toffee Victoria sponge red currant raspberry and more oak build into a thick luscious mouthful. Any smoke drifts away in the initial seconds. Toffee and fruit linger making a very lengthy finish. A masterful top of the range blend from La Martinquaise. Well worth seeking out.Â â‚¬55
Duncan Taylor 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,25,When in doubt the answer to any question is usually â€˜more whisky.' Here peat smoke takes an upper hand over the sweet aromas of juicy orange and pear. The whisky begins icing-sugar sweet settles to bubble gum pear apple and malt showing its impeccably balanced finely textured character replete with strands of oak spices gentle smoke baked pastry and vanilla custard. You can't go wrong at this price.
Moon Harbour Pier #2 Peated Edition 47.1%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,70,Was the short finish in ChÃ¢teau La LouviÃ¨re casks from Bordeaux's Pessac-LÃ©ognan appellation sufficient to impact this peaty whisky? A gorgeous color with a nose of sooty charcoal intensity hints of chocolate vanilla pod clove and peppercorn. Flavors of cherry rhubarb orange peel and plums speckled with aniseed pepper clove and licorice indicate cask influence. Suggestions of menthol and peppermint before a smoky finish with licorice and bitter chocolate. (20000 bottles)
J. Mossman Gold Crown 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,88,43,Aromas of oloroso sherry strawberry almond paste clove licorice Allsorts black treacle and smoke from burning haystacks. Honeyed palate with citrus elements light lemon green melon pear redcurrant and pineapple brightened by some well-rounded spices and root ginger. It glides into a mouthful of chocolate-coated digestive biscuits with a little smoke then a finish of citrus oils fruit skins and active spices. Brilliant and satisfying.
Compass Box The Entertainer 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,135,This is a special bottling for London department store Selfridge's but it represents a clever strategy by artisan Compass Box to set its own agenda by regionalizing its whiskies. This is a long way from the New York blendâ€”indeed creamier and sweeter than other recent releases. It has a honey heart traces of cinnamon and menthol in the mix plus wispy smoke. There's some spice and peat late on but in relatively subdued form. Very pleasant. Â£85
Compass Box Great King Street Experimental OO-V4 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,48,Great King Street was our Blend of the Year two years ago and Compass Box wondered where to take it next. So they have released two versions asking customers to decide between them by voting online. The other one is peated and will probably win easily which is a shame because this is a more subtle and better whisky. Sherry syrup honey apple and sultanas are all here but nuanced. Delightful.Â Â£30
The Famous Grouse Double Matured 16 year old Vic Lee Edition 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,99,Just eight whiskies in the blend married and finished in first fill Spanish sherry and bourbon casks. An insistent nose crackling with spices with toasted Eccles cake anointed with grated nutmeg vanilla extract cassia and dark soy sauce. Light honey and vanilla tangerine oils and lime peel exhibit perfectly-paced development with flavor building over a minute or more. Warming ginger spices and tropical fruits of guava and papaya close out this first annual special edition. Impressive work.
Johnnie Walker Gold 18 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,65,An example that older more expensive isn't always better this 18 year old gem is as good as many blends twice its price. The foundation of Johnnie Walker Gold is delicate clean and honeyed along with a fresh sea character (from Clynelish?) that provides a youthful zing. Notes of vanilla shortbread tropical fruit freshly cut hay marshmallow and even a hit of peat round out the palate. Its finish is subtly complex and nicely balanced. The blend has improved nicely over the past several years. 
Johnnie Walker Blenders' Batch Wine Cask 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,30,Blender AimÃ©e Gibson set out to make a sundowner scotch by incorporating whiskies matured in wine casks. The blueberry blackcurrant and fresh oak aromas continue on to the palate: fruit compote raspberry strawberry and lingonberry with light spices. A late resurgence of dark toffee chocolate and cigar smoke blow into the finish. Sip away by all means but this fruity sensation calls to be served up in long cool drinks.
Chivas 25 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,300,Chivas's new entry into the premium blend category. A complex whisky (on the nose and palate) in the same vein as Chivas 18 only deeper with more caramelized sweetness darker fruit and greater emphasis on dried spices and roasted nuts (and perhaps even tobacco). Everything moves along nicely -- and entertainingly -- until the whisky approaches the finish on the palate. Its age begins to show as spicy oak dryness and suggestions of polished leather begin to dominate through to the finish. An enjoyable whisky but I prefer the 18 year old to the 25 year old for its impeccable balance.
Classic Cask 23 year old Oloroso Sherry Butt 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,160,A charmingly sweet nose with Christmas cake swollen raisin dates sticky toffee pudding walnut nutmeg and gentle spices confirm the presence of the oloroso cask at work. An oily texture with butterscotch tangy peel and mandarin becoming darker and nutty with sultana and plum skin shading into menthol and streaks of bitterness. Finally Brazil nut macadamia and clove with a hot dry nutty finish. (771 bottles)
The Antiquary 1977 vintage 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,300,Deep on the nose and palate with notes of dark rum dried fruit roasted nuts dark chocolate cinnamon polished leather charcoal and a suggestion of peat.Â  Dry resinous finish.Â  Bonus points for intrigue.
The Antiquary 35 year old 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,460,The aromas can be split into four; fresh fruits (raspberry blueberry) desserts (vanilla custard bread and butter pudding) antique shop (polished furniture well-oiled moving parts) and stewed fruits (apple rhubarb some old orange peel). Wisps of balsa wood smoke; tangy orange notes build accompanied by those fresh fruits sweet oak aniseed and white pepper ending on black treacle and gingerbread. The finish is epically long; dry floral with parkin residual wood notes and further smoke evident. (800 bottles)
Black Bull Kyloe 50%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,29,Kyloe is the old Scots name for the famous hairy horned breed of Highland beef cattle better known in Scotland as a Heilan coo. This bright NAS whisky has aromas of fresh orange lemon grapefruit and light muscovado sugar. It is soft and sweet to drink with lemon sherbet notes some fruity piquancy and rich butterscotch with some peppermint creeping in on the finish.
Old Masters Freemason Whisky 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,30,Originally created by Lombard for the Freemasons this has a flavorsome nose of dark chocolate chip cookies light spices coconut macaroons malt and bright fresh bananas. The palate is light and unobtrusive with honey and malt reinforced by the spices running underneath. A shift develops to some later cocoa and chocolate notes and the mocha finish fades gracefully. A finely balanced concoction and you will rarely find this quality and flavor for the price
That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky #1 (Batch 2) 52%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,178,If you like warm chocolate ganache sprinkled with cocoa beans dark waffle cones praline and brisket bark then this is for you. A brief flicker of chocolate smoke cherry peppery spices and chili flakes move aside for a smooth medley of dark fruit juiciness and sweetened char notes. The strident call of chocolate on nosing goes unreciprocated on the palate. A long satisfying deep finish of pounding spices. A worthy successor to the first batch. (417 bottles) Â£123
Hankey Bannister Heritage Blend 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,42,Hankey Bannister includes some stunning aged whiskies in its range but given the trend toward unaged scotch releases I was a bit suspicious of this. It lacks depth but nevertheless is a butterfly in a breeze of a whisky; gossamer light both tantalizing and elusive. It's liquid honey with sweet lime and pear some cocoa and to give it a modicum of depth it's underpinned by a light saltiness.
Grand Macnish Black Edition 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,30,I am hopeful this blended whisky has benefited from the alligator char treatment to contribute to the deep rich color and charred smoke notes on the nose. A thick velvety mouthfeel with butter toffee toasted marshmallows going gooey on a stick great spices vanilla whole nutmeg chicory and the crust of a well-fired fruit loaf leaving some sooty cinders on the finish. A mighty fireside companion and my favorite Grand Macnish to date.
Lord Elcho 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,43,Lord Elcho was an 18th century ancestor of William Wemyss who fought on Bonnie Prince Charlie's side at the Battle of Culloden in 1745. With a minimum of 40% malt this fine blend has a rather perfumed nose of fresh mint green apple sliced melon and tropical fruits. The soft candy sugar and butterscotch palate builds with layers of malt cherry laces gingerbread and pfeffernÃ¼sse leading to a ginger and spice finish of significant length. Highly accomplished.Â Â£26
Highland Queen 1561 30 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,87,302,A limited edition blend with more than 75 percent malt content containing grains from 1978 and 1979 and malts from 1982. A genteel nose exudes white chocolate vanilla slice butterscotch fresh apricots and salted pecans. Commanding and rich it luxuriates in bitter orange ripe apricots marmalade dairy toffees cinnamon and raspberry with a finish of Seville orange rind. It's a little blander with water toward baked lemons and barley sugar so resist and take it as it comes.Â Â£190
John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2015 Edition 46.8%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,805,This second release celebrates Walker's rare fruit character using 29 handpicked casks combining regional styles aligned to the 2010 Director's Blend. Aromas of pear and fresh apple layered over tangy sugar-tossed dried fruits pineapple deep orange oils and dry peel. Taciturn smoke. Creamy butteriness with red apple raspberry and sweet orange yields to soft chewy pear skins honey-drizzled Turkish delights and charred paper. An outlier of JW character but important to contemplate how this adds context to the entire collection.Â Â£550
Chivas Regal The Chivas Brothers' Blend 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,58,Intended to recreate the spirit of James and John Chivas this blend uses high proportions of Longmorn and Strathisla malts. The nose has green apples peaches in syrup blended honey and oat flapjacks. A soft and light opener of orange sherbet melon and dried apple. Dilution yields a delicious creamy texture with more assertive citrus flavors and bitter peel showing by the end. A distinctive character from the regular 12 year old but this should be regarded as an equal. Â£40
Chivas Regal 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,25,The assured Scotch whisky that became one of the classic blends. Dry and sweet with a nose of vanilla sponge fresh cut flowers and marzipan over a malty base. Pleasingly oily with flavors of burning butter malty toffee and cake mix with gentle spices and hints of chocolate appearing the longer you hold off swallowing. The glossy mouthfeel makes this feel like an everyday luxury. A finish of spent spices cocoa hazelnut and a waft of smoke brings it home.
The Antiquary 21 year old 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,100,Consummately blended from more than 30 different whiskies this has chewy Highland toffee freshly-baked banana muffins shelled walnuts and faint chocolate orange notes. A smooth full mouthful of blossoming orange thick malt heather honey dabs of espresso and milk chocolate. The malty Horlicks flavors prevail to the end with some attractive shimmering spices. Note the higher strength here though the 45% malt content is consistent across the range.
Wemyss Malts Peat Chimney 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,54,Imagine your nose hovering inches above well-dried peat then throw in salted nuts brittle toffee and an intensification of vanilla pods. This feels more rounded and balanced than earlier bottlings and is the better for it. Warm sweet caramel juicy orange and lime zest are shot through with peat the rising smoke driving you back while pepper and ginger give close support. The most improved of the Wemyss three but a bit more heft in the composition wouldn't go amiss. Â£37
Black Bull 8 year old 50%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,39,The youngest age statement Bull in the fold this one has shredded citrus peel fleshy grapefruit candied orange peel and lemon meringue pie. Soft fudge honey tart lemon and buttery pastry with a nip of peppery spice under the tongue complete a satisfying combination. A delicious everyday kind of dram and I preferred this expression's brightness and attack of the flavors over the 12 year old.
Islay Mist 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,50,More rounded with greater depth when compared to the 8 year old offering. Not as medicinal and less sweet more toffee and less honey with more dried spice interwoven throughout. The herbs are still there along with licorice root. Dry burning-ember finish. Nicely balanced which makes it my favorite of the three.
The Black Grouse 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,29,One might assume this to be just a smoky version of the standard Famous Grouse (with its honeyed malt bright fruit and floral demeanor). But in addition to the enhanced smoke (which caringly adds a new dimension without smothering the other flavors) there also seems to be more malt body and oak spice in the mix which I think takes Black Grouse to a higher level than Famous Grouse. The grain whisky contributes a â€œdrinkabilityâ€ component making it a great introduction to smoky whiskies.
Master of Malt Reference Series II 47.5%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,85,Now listen up class it's time for your next whisky lesson. Here the educational blend contains 20% very old single malt which delivers a nose of citrus peel honey air-dried ham and some spices in the background. Quite delicious with orange vanilla sponge raisin cremola foam assuaged by plain chocolate and Black Forest gateau. This concoction is further tweaked three ways to complete Reference Series II. A truly great drink in its own right that makes learning fun again.Â Â£56
Ballantine's 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions â€“ Glentauchers 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,80,Glentauchers distillery is another Chivas Brothers workhorse located deep in the Speyside countryside. Through the aromas of honey caramel and vanilla peek barley stalks hard pears and hints of Cadbury buttons. The flavor opens sweet with red berries and Parma violets. Although this is intended to follow a lighter style it's very flavorsome with creamy vanilla poached pear and dried apple. A juicy finish with fruitiness oozing from the cheeks.
Ballantine's 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,38,Wow! A noticeable step up in quality than Ballantine's Finest (see below) with a perceptibly higher malt content. After Eight mints Rolo toffees spring florals clean and creamy plus some wood combine to produce an appealing nose. One sip confirms that this is gorgeously honeyed layered thick and creamy with heather honey sweet oak and ripe fruits especially orange and mango. The finish is short drying sweet and the only weak spot in an otherwise decent composition.
Blue Hanger 8th Release 45.6%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,115,This breaks Blue Hanger ranks because it's a traditional blended whisky rather than a blend of just malts. Not that you see the joins. This is a rich powerful clean and crisp whisky with a delightfully balanced flavor of pureed fruits and an unusual almost menthol quality. Smoke wanders in and out to complete the experience. (The Whisky Shop exclusive.)
William Grant's 18 year old Rare 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,78,The last eighteen months have been very good ones for blended and blended malt Scotch whisky. Shackleton and Compass Box set out in a fresh direction and there were top releases from the likes of Johnnie Walker and Blue Hanger. So quality brands from the likes of Grant's have to rethink. This is well made tasty balanced complex and drinkable without water or a mixer. But shouldn't a premium whisky justify a strength of 46% ABV? I think so. Â£50
Royal Salute The Eternal Reserve 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,180,Let me introduce you to infinity blending. 88 casks were blended and married in 88 casks for 6 months then blended with another 88 casks. Half is bottled and half retained at Strathisla's Royal Salute vault for the next batch. The process is as fascinating as the whisky. Caramel toffee green apple Jaffa orange and vanilla pod aromas. Dark sweetness fresh orange accents: polished juicy and thirst quenching though the brilliance lies in the amaranthine finish. (Global Travel Retail only)
Grand Macnish 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,25,With a bottle shape that makes you want to go bowling this blend has admirable balance between the fruit and the smoke on the nose. The bonfire smoke is matched with aromas of tarte tartin pecan nut red apple and sultana. Smooth and molten in the mouth it has more weight and body than its older brother. There is citrus apples and the late arrival of baked spices cookie dough and mint chocolate on the finish.
Label 5 Extra Premium 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,25,This is bursting with barley sweet oak and all-butter shortbread. There are charcoal sticks too which add a cool smoke note. The taste is like a warm hug on a cold morning; flavors of butter toffee orange poached pear and ginger snaps which combine to keep that deep smoke in balance. The harmony continues into the lengthy finish with flavors of citrus melon and ground ginger.
 J. Mossman Platinum Crown 15 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,86,54,Nutty nose with toasted oak savory peppered meats and traces of wood smoke. It starts off deceptively lightweight with sweet juicy mandarin before a takeover of sharper citrus elements. Honey and gorgeous silky caramels slink by chased by a gentle swish of spice. Light pepperiness with chocolate notes ushers in an aromatic finish. A tasty blend but the nose will not be everyone's choice.
Compass Box Great King Street Experimental TR-06 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,48,One of two blended whiskies vying to be the official next Great King Street release this is the peated version and it's gustier than the original with less citrus and more peat. Indeed it's impressively full-flavored with peat in the driving seat and ginger cake lime and dark chocolate biscuits and pepper in the mix. Best of all unlike far too many Scotch whiskies this year it doesn't use peat to hide immature spirit.Â Â£30
Famous Grouse Mellow Gold 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,33,This has enticing flavors that will meet with the approval of the regular Grouse drinker: heady florals with fresh peach light honey pecan and underlying caramel. The palate is soothing with vanilla and tangerine hallmarks of Grouse plus rosewater almond and whispering spices. Gently does it that's the key to this: kick back and relax. This showcases the Midas touch of Gordon Motion's skills in liquid alchemy. A great value blend to boot.Â Â£22
Johnnie Walker Explorers' Club Royal Route 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,159,I had to double check that price. My feelings are well recorded on premium whiskies bottled at 40% and if you were to ask me whether the whisky's worth the price tag the answer's no. That doesn't make it a bad whisky though; far from it. It has a light dusty and fruity nose reminiscent of raspberry sherbet and on the palate there is trademark smoke and pleasant toffee and treacle. Good but in stellar company here. (Travel Retail only) Price is per liter.
Chivas Regal Extra 40% ,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,40,A new oloroso-forward Chivas positioned to split between the 12 and 18 year olds? I got this. Refined and inviting nose of lemon pith black fruits and Kola Kubes. The velvety texture is wonderfully smooth redolent of an apricot custard Danish lime zest raisin currant mixed peel and walnut with a growing bitter-lemon note. Quite unique finish like sucking on lumpy Spanish lemons speckled with spices. (LA NY Miami Chicago Northern California but will go national)
Dewar's White Label Scratched Cask 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,26,What lies beneath the surface of Dewar's? Here the blend is finished in virgin and first-fill bourbon casks especially charred then scratched to enable deeper penetration. Thick wedge of vanilla and fudge with oaky accents a dusty mouthfeel pulling in vanilla light lemon milk chocolate and sweet toffee ending on a cocoa powder note. Compared with regular White Label this is less obviously sweet and creamy adds complexity and opens a bourbon connection. Certainly this is up to scratch.
Dewar's 18 year old The Vintage 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,80,Vanilla laced with spice fondant icing grapefruit peel and lime zest leave the vanilla and floral notes lower down the pecking order. In the mouth grapefruit and orange dominate the vanilla yet the mouthfeel is thinner and the acidity tips toward the taste of bitter orange seeds. A lingering bitter orange finish.
 Dewar's White Label 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,25,Honey fudge a little melon and white grape dry roasted spices and peppercorn but noticeably less fruit than the age-statement varieties. The palate has pulpy white melon lemon lime and some grapefruit acidity before sweetening with honey. Quite tart at times some peppery spice collaborates before the vanilla cream and green fruits take charge. A clean juicy finish of lemon zest and mild spices coats the throat.
King's Crest 25 year 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,225,Delicate yet nicely balanced. Notes of peaches and cream meadow flowers subtle berry fruits soft vanilla and light honey. Gentle pleasing oak finish. Nice dovetailing of flavors and very drinkable. A good example of a lighter-style mature blend and quite the antithesis of the Johnnie Walker Blue Anniversary bottling reviewed above. A pleasing warm weather scotch or perhaps before dinner as an aperitif. 
Shieldaig 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,31,This is a sharp dresser with a firm solid mouthfeel and an altogether finer and more focused taste than Shieldaig Classic (see below). It's not coastal or earthy particularly either. Instead the flavors are softer and built around mocha smooth creamy toffee and some soft fruit including a touch of overripe banana and melon notes. The savoriness this time comes from a touch of pepper rather than salt.
James Brookes Blended Whisky 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,18,This is like listening to a quiet and understated musician and slowly starting to realize that there are all sorts of clever nuances just beneath the surface. This evolves from a floral and welcoming nose through a saline note and on to pepper and a Highland earthiness but wrapped up in a rich honeyed body. A nice balance between the ruggedness and sweet softness. All rather pleasant.
Sir Edward's Smoky 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,22,This blend delivers just enough peat turf to live up to the name without alienating the peat phobics. A pleasant nose of chocolate hazelnut pecan nut dried tropical fruits and gentle wood and peat smoke.Â  Orange toffee banoffee pie Kola Kubes and a little spiciness. Plenty of flavor even if the mouthfeel is a little thin. A short finish with a spicy flare and a few lingering smoky embers. (Total Wine exclusive) Price per 1.75 liter
The Lost Distilleries Blend (batch 6) 49.3%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,512,The sixth incarnation of Master of Malt's cult blend of closed distillery whiskies contains Port Ellen Brora Mosstowie Glenisla Imperial Caperdonich and Glen Mhor with grain whisky from Port Dundas. Apples and sugar browning in a pan smooth driftwood and dairy fudge but with the Glenisla it's noticeably smokier than earlier batches. Sweet blancmange initially before it soars to a tangy spicy peak; the peat smoke backed by white pepper ground ginger peanuts and florentines. Smokin' liquid history. (534 bottles)Â Â£350
The Lost Distillery Company Gerston (batch 2/1) 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,65,A pale primrose of a dram. Waxed lemon salted butter pats white peach honey and the wood smoke from green stems. A sip brings Highland toffee honey chocolate fudge rich tart fruits with dried apple raisin mixed peel and a late appearance of malt pepper and smoke. It wraps up with a glossy clingy finish but it's short. Experimenting with water nudges peanut brittle pralines and fudge to the surface. Overall a very decent drop.
Duncan Taylor 18 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,70,A toasty and spicier interpretation of an 18 year old blend. Toffee salted pecans Dundee cake and sultana aromas. A beautiful thick texture replete with ripe red fruits cardamom fennel and star anise. Caramels drift past on a river of spice wreathed in a fine layer of smoke then oak mixed nuts and cracker bread. The fruity sweetness is momentary and fleeting leaving the front of the mouth loaded with spice.
Duncan Taylor Five Star 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,17,It begins innocently enough. Ripening strawberries cotton candy and fudge on the nose but with an undertow of devil-may-care spiciness. Soft mandarin citrus vanilla fudge sponge cupcakes and a decent wedge of malt form the core of the palate; the spice is disappointingly mild considering the potential of the first sniff. Sweet and syrupy finish. Still solid enough to make your world better at the end of a hard day.
Usquaebach 15 year old 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,80,The blended malt in the series is drawn from select aged Highland single malt whiskies chosen by Stewart Laing. A luxuriant nose of rich runny caramels deliciously malty and balanced with notes of dried apple mixed peel and pecan shells layered over warm spice. Smooth with a light to medium body showing toffee apple raisin and caramel tasting fatter with time and yielding pineapple notes. A finish of soft sucked toffees and tingly spices. A top-class well-executed drink.
Buchanan's Deluxe 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,30,Overlook the fact that this bottle is saddled with one of the most impenetrable closures known to mankind. Unperturbed this blend flaunts its big toffee aromas whole almond and floral top notes. With light fudge and gentle orange influences it is smooth and rounded top loaded with spice and hazelnut at the front of the mouth. More grain character and roasted spices show through on the finish.
Buchanan's Master 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,45,This adheres to the rules laid down by blender Keith Law. The nose yields mint toffees cereal notes butterscotch and whole peppercorn. Juicy orange with elements of burnt orange dark toffees and a pleasant balance of sweetness form the palate followed by a wave of peppery spices and late dashes of dates and sultana. The finish has more peppery spice and peppermint. Obey the Law.
J&B Rare 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,23,Justerini & Brooks sold scotch in the U.S. before Prohibition. This light Speyside-style blend has grassy notes with crystalized lemon slices Bramley apple peel woodsmoke and almonds. Light and sweet on the tongue it unpacks lemon peel satsuma juicy watermelon pepper and aniseed. Grain whisky and herbal notes creep in late and permeate the finish.
Compass Box 'The Spice Tree' 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,65,The second generation of The Spice Tree. (This new expression sports a much larger tree image on the front label.) While the first bottling used inner French oak staves to impart additional oak influence this one uses French oak barrel heads. This new bottling is also bolder displaying more oak -- there are more dried spice notes and it's more viscous and clinging on the palate. (It's also less elegant than the original bottling.) Notes of sticky toffee vanilla fudge bramble and red currant give way to oak resin cinnamon clove nutmeg and subtle lemongrass. A tactile somewhat resinous polished leather finish wraps it up. A nice whisky but I really enjoy the subtler more elegant nature of the original bottling better.
Johnnie Walker Red Label 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,25,How does this long-established blend shape up on its own without a ginger or soda mixer? Fresh apple juice a twist of lemon dried orange peel peppercorn cracker bread and a vegetal spicy note. It gets into its stride with delicious apple gentle fudge and good-tempered spices with cracked black pepper and a little sourness to finish. Mild agreeably smooth without any bombast or hullabaloo; it just blends in.
The Antiquary 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,27,Thick viscous golden syrup digestive biscuits and Almond Joy bars underpin some soft peaty aromas. It's rather an appealing combination. Satin smooth on the tongue with lemon lime orange and dried pineapple but enough malt to keep things interesting. The finish riffs on a ripe lemon theme accompanied by spicy stardust. For the few extra bucks the more mature component whiskies make for a richer fuller and more satisfying experience than The Antiquary's red-labeled bottle.
Black Bull 12 year old 50%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,55,A solid presence in the range the strength and malt content continue to mark these out over their contemporaries. Grapefruit peels sliced juicy orange and lemon butter icing on the nose. The palate is thinner than others in the range with crystallized orange fudge plus cardamom and mild pepper. The finish of sugared satsumas is boosted by a long lasting trail of spices.
Isle of Skye 8 year old 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,29,What a surprise! Really thick and malty for a blend (there's a high malt content here for sure) and also nicely mature for 8 years old. Great balance too with the island aggressiveness tamed by a rich malty elegance. Delicious honey toasted oak firm peat dark chocolate and glazed citrus meld nicely with the malt leading to a honeyed lightly-peppered finish. Very enjoyable.
Lombard Gold Label 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,17,Good weight to this blend. Creamy and mouth-coating on the palate with a nice malty honey-tinged backbone. Bright fruitabounds with golden raisin lemon meringue peach and a hint of pineapple. Notes of creamy vanilla and gently nutty through to its soft finish. 
Islay Mist 17 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,80,Deeper and darker when compared to its younger siblings but with the same personality. Drier especially on the finish with added oak resin espresso leather and tobacco. Bonus points for character.
Master of Malt Boxes Blend 40.9%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,90,Master of Malt is an online whisky company that seems to try its hand at most things and is bringing a fresh irreverence to the world of whisky. This was created in partnership with the bass guitarist of British rock band Athlete and it's rather good. Sweet and rich with toffee orange chocolate and honey it's another blend with a lot to say for itself. Â Â£55
Master of Malt Secret Bottlings Series 8 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,35,Master of Malt has accumulated quite a trophy cabinet for their work on blends. The nose is inviting with butter toffee Bramley apples fennel seeds cut lawns and chocolate-covered oat biscuits. It's a pretty smooth proposition serving up caramel maltiness stewed apple and orange and grapefruit pith with just a hint of sharp lemon freshness to open up with. The ginger finish is zappy but short. A solid everyday blend.
Grant's Signature 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,29,Brian Kinsman's new creation was inspired by their founder William Grant with a remit to create a malty blend of character. Digestive biscuits malt honeycomb and confectioner's chocolate melted over a bain-marie. It's a satisfyingly rich dram well-structured with a great mouthfeel that wanes with natural dilution. Banoffee pie caramel biscuits and maltiness deepen to flavors of coffee bean and molasses leaving a teeth-coating finish of black coffee. (UK and France only)Â Â£18
Sir Edward's 12 year old Blended Whisky 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,22,A very different whisky to its unaged namesake and most unlike any of the other blends tasted for this issue. That's no bad thing. This is less sweet than most blends with tobacco leaf and ashtray to the fore and a dusty grainy note with a touch of oak grape skin and sweet heather. That said not a lot of evidence of the 12 years in cask.
Royal Salute The Diamond Tribute 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,270,How can you really compare this to a quality blend priced under $50? It's hard not to view this as a victory of style over substance and I object to premium whiskies being just 40% ABV but nevertheless this is excellently made and the blending of whiskies over 21 years is exemplary. It's rich and viscous with light peach and plum notes and a pleasant earthy base.
Highland Queen 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,76,At this age there are more linear displays of fruit and sweetness than the 8 year old. Behind the tarte tatin butterscotch light pepper and wood spice is a green verdant nose of wet foliage and public lawns in the morning mist. It has a light to medium-weight texture of sugary butterscotch strawberry and raspberry developing around an oak and malt core. When the fruit flavor withers there is a drop off in flavor leaving a malty melee.Â Â£48
Syndicate 58/6 Premium 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,160,An odd non-age stated blend that uses a solera system to get a drop of the original 1958 blend into the mix. The blend is then finished for four years in oloroso casks. It's a bit of blending gymnastics. Very sherry influenced with marionberry jam malt salt and oak. The integration and flavors are nice but it all feels a bit muted. A medium length and dry finish shows off some of the younger spirit in the mix. (U.S. only)
Label 5 Gold Heritage 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,45,Master blender Graham Coull hand-selected a variety of aged stock and cask types for this new global addition to the Label 5 range. Vanilla dark fruit and gentle spices on the nose but the appeal lies in the beautiful clingy mouthfeel. Warm marmalade nuts and oak flavors with whispers of cinnamon and clove combine to produce a creamy smooth dram. It builds and builds but never feels like it fully arrives. The finish is drying with dampened-down spices.Â â‚¬40
Glen Turner Heritage Double Wood 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,20,It's Double Wood Jim but not as we know it. Here the blend has been given a Madeira finish presenting an appealing nose of spun sugar golden raisins cinnamon nutmeg and hazelnut. The blend has a creamy texture with good weight to carry the flavors of orange peel mango and dried pineapple leading to a zesty spark on swallowing. Wood spices nuttiness and lingering toffee make for a satisfying finish. The extra Madeira maturation is understated and perfectly judged.
Jamie Stewart 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,16,With whiskies aged for 5 years in bourbon barrels this has a pleasant nose of dark toffee vanilla toasted whole grain bread and light spices. The mouthfeel is a bit flabby; chocolate and toasted spices especially cinnamon and pepper are quelled by malty caramel baked orange and touches of old leather. The finish is dry malty and slightly nutty with a hollow core of spices. A bit dour overall.
John Barr Reserve 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,84,25,This blend has been a Whyte and MacKay whisky for 25 years. The nose has spice toffee wheat biscuits and smoke but the combination feels a little benign. The palate is jammy lightweight and middle-of-the-road. With a backbone of grain there are flavors of graham cracker chocolate ganache well-baked fruitcake banoffee pie smoke and dried peels with a burst of spices on the finish.
Compass Box Oak Cross 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,83,40,A blend of three different single malts. Its name derives from the fact that the whisky is aged in American oak bodies with French Oak heads (a cross of both oaks). There's no age statement but the whiskies are all older than ten years. This is a gentle subtly complex somewhat lithe easy drinking whisky (and with less oak spice than its predecessor The Spice Tree). People think whisky is an after-dinner drink but I think this would make a great aperitif because of its delicate dry spice notes and light body. I'm picking up evenly-proportioned notes of vanilla and coconut with more subtle notes of clove anise and delicate fruit all wrapped up in a gentle malty body. A very versatile whisky. 
Johnnie Walker Explorers' Club Collection The Gold Route 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,83,95,Described as â€œan exotic mix of bananas mango pitaya pineapples guava passion fruit and raisins all balanced perfectly by deep charred peaty notes.â€ It sort of is but this isn't a soft silky smooth dessert whisky; it's Rod Stewart singing Air Supply's â€œAll Out Of Love.â€ It's soft and gentle but the gravel may put off the softies and it's far too bland to appeal to fans of Maggie May. Between a rock and a hard place.
Black Bottle 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,83,25,In terms of bang for your buck this has always been one of the very best blends punching well above its weight. Whether you feel the same about this revamped version depends on how much you want a peat punch. Previously rough and gutsy this is softer with more licorice and treacle but also more younger sappiness. Smoke has the last say but it's like an aging sportsman replacing energy and attitude with guile and subtlety.
The Antiquary 12 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,83,30,Floral aroma with a lively array of orchard fruit and citrus.Â  Underlying notes of soft honey and vanilla.Â  Good malt foundation for a blend.Â  An elegant and breezy anytime dram.
The Black Grouse Alpha 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,83,45,The Famous Grouse has been extended in various directions with varying degrees of success but for my money this is the best and most logical. This is the version where the smoky oily spicy and peaty notes of the original blend are brought more to the fore but this works because married to it are grape and melon notes that ensure the Grouse lands softly.
Grant's Voyager 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,83,32,Molten blossom honey almond milk puddings and Parma violets interlaced with a fine drifting chimney smoke compose the nose of this new blend from William Grant & Sons. Smooth burnished orange and honey cough drops initially then the flavor develops through more pronounced citrus and gentle spices to achieve a sweeter climax. The grain is quite evident in the harmony of the blend. The finish is long more beeswax than honey the sweetness finally depleted. (Travel Retail only)Â Â£20
House of Hazelwood 21 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,83,98,A spicier character to represent 1920s Bombay (now Mumbai) yields an intriguing nose of cumin dried apple cardamom and roasted coriander seed walnut shells dry meat from the tandoor and aged cigars in Spanish cedar. A rather gluey texture with a dominant cinnamon note interjected by spicy fruit from the European oak and gentle cloves. A short finish leaves a reverberation of spices and chicory root. The aromas are wonderful but it comes unstuck with the mouthfeel. Â£75
The Tweeddale 14 year old Batch 4 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,83,76,This batch of 1420 bottles was created with slightly older malts a 16 year old grain from a refill hogshead and a 14 year old Lowland malt disgorged from an Islay cask. Sugar mice dried hay sharpened pencils hints of lemon with subtle smoke like the burning of a distant stubble field. Sweet cereal notes black pepper and ginger parkin build to a conclusion of Brazil nut mocha and chocolate ganache. (UK & Netherlands only)Â Â£45
Lord Elcho 15 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,83,44,The eldest son of the 5th earl of Wemyss Lord Elcho was supportive to the Young Pretender. Proportionally more sherry at play here. Plum skin chunky raisins blackcurrant and fainter sweetened cocoa and coffee bean notes. The palate is a little hollow at first then proffers barley sugar rich shortbread baked apple linseed and toffee though the flavor development plateaus. Water picks out sweet clementine notes. Given the choice of expressions I prefer the vibrancy of the Young(er) Pretender.Â Â£26
The Lost Distillery Company Stratheden (batch 2/2) 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,83,65,Slabs of plain chocolate Kendal mint cake vanilla essence and malt with a dry dusty character makes this suggest itself for an after-dinner occasion. The palate is very sweet; sugarplum caramelized brown sugar flapjacks bramble and pink rhubarb before it finally coagulates into a thick Horlicks maltiness. There's an impressive trajectory of flavor here though the mouthfeel is nothing special and dilution doesn't enhance it to any real degree. Dry and malty finish.
Usquaebach Old Rare Stone Flagon 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,83,115,Hunter Laing blended this grand Highland whisky: an 85% malt-driven recipe of more mature stock. I liked its aromas of dripping caramels dry peats soft hay and faint pepper balancing the resilient smoky character. There's the juiciness of mandarin oranges too. The blend is smooth and well-textured beginning with sugared orange malt vanilla and toasted spices which glide into clove and black pepper. The drying finish has spicy pepper ground ginger and lasting citrus.
Johnnie Walker Blenders' Batch No. 1 Red Rye Finish 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,82,22,America Walker wants your cocktails. Emma Walker that is the blender whose signature adorns the first of these experimental expressions. Toffee Speyside nose digestive biscuits cinnamon cool mint and a pronounced grain note from Port Dundas. Orange lime peel lovely caramel richness and creamy toffee through dilution. The brand's second consecutive rye cask finish: you noticed too? Up against its sibling JW Select Rye Cask there are certain similarities but this is fruitier less intricate and less rich and spicy.
Lombard Speyside 8 year old 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,82,30,Quite fragrant and fairly sweet (but not cloyingly so) rich with nutty toffee nougat and bright summer fruits. Clean gently sweet finish. Well rounded nicely matured for its age and at $30 a good value these days. A versatile whisky to keep in the drinks cabinet; it's enjoyable enough sipping neat or with a splash of water but (at this price) you won't cringe if your guests drink it on the rocks or use it as a mixer. 
Master of Malt 10 year old 47.5%,Blended Scotch Whisky,82,64,Batch 1 of this new blend brings oxidized apple maple syrup crispy potato skins soft spices and nutmeg grated over eggnog. Rich strands of citrus mint and raisins mingle building in intensity to greater spiciness at the swallow where ginger and burnt sugar emerges. Undiluted there is a hot spicy slightly acrid finish dominated by the ginger. Water adds melon mandarin and apple and manages to keep the ginger in check.Â Â£40
Shieldaig Classic 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,82,18,In blended whisky terms this isn't for the faint-hearted and joins a number of recent releases prepared to show off its darker grittier side. It's a big flavored blend with its heart in the islands and with oily coastal notes reminiscent of a delicatessen: brine salty cheese some crab apple relish and smoked fish. It's a rugged bruiser but it makes its mark with some style.
Monarch of The Glen 8 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,82,15,Standard blends fall into two categories: those that will behave nicely when mixed to offer almost non-whisky experience and those that are feistier and want to make sure you know they're there. This is the former and with whiskies like this one it's possible to blink and miss it. That doesn't make it bad; just indistinctive and unexceptional. There is little sign of the wood here but the delicate sweet apricot notes just do enough.
Grand Macnish Sherry Cask 15 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,82,35,Naming your blend â€œSherry Caskâ€ retains an air of ambiguity to it. Theoretically it could be the maturation or finishing vessel for all or some of the constituents. The whisky is light-bodied and the sweet sherry is evident though a nip of bitterness interrupts. Smoother on the palate than the 12 year old there's strawberry raspberry and background spice with a blackberry note late in the finish. Overall there's less flavor development but it's an old-school kind of blend.
The Fat Trout 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,82,25,Delicate nose of sherbet and melting heather honey layered over pleasant grassy and herbal notes. The texture is sweet thin and syrupy with a slight vegetal note before salted caramel reels it in brimming over into a briny finish like a salty kiss. The grain clearly plays a major role. Truth be told the aromas and flavors work well but the lack of weight makes it feel like a tiddler rather than catch of the day. (Selected U.S. states NZ Switzerland).
Label 5 Classic Black 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,82,17,This is the foundation stone of the whole Label 5 range and it's a solid reputable blend that works neat with a rock of ice or in cocktails. The digestive biscuits dark walnut toffee and fruit salad aromas concede to a rather inauspicious palate of burnt orange malt biscuits charred oak and ground ginger. It's lively through to its malt and spice conclusion.
Usquaebach Reserve 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,82,40,This blend is generously half malt and half grain unusually selecting 16-18 year old malts. The result has a nose of rich honey and florals resplendent in a citrus intensity: squeezed orange skin with a background note of dry crackers. The palate is orange and malty with cola faint spices and a little waxiness but the core feels a little hollow. A good length finish where the pleasant buzz has a slight peatiness rubbed in. A decent stand-up dram.
Ballantine's 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions â€“ Miltonduff 43%,Blended Scotch Whisky,81,80,A light oily nose a little nutty baked apple cinnamon nutmeg and malt biscuits. There are seductive dark spices and cooked fruit almost savory like lifting the lid on a tagine. A thinner mouthfeel showing some lime zest before a warm enveloping glow of malt sweetness gentle spice toffee raisin and char emerges. Savory peppery finish. Like nightfall it gets darker the longer you contemplate it. With water sweeter with more candied citrus as honeys materialize.
Ballantine's Finest 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,81,21,A pleasant nose of light caramel dried orange rind butterscotch sweet grain and a lick of bonfire smoke yet it's like the volume has been dialed down to three. Delicate to the point of shyness. Sweet barley concentrated orange a low rumble of spice and the grain sings through. Accessible well structured and light-textured leading to a finish of brown sugar around the gums although it has a stronger grain character than many in its price range.
Sir Edward's Blended Whisky 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,81,14,From the perfumed nose to the sweet and short finish this blend doesn't really put a foot wrong but it's shy and unadventurous. Clearly well made well balanced and quite acceptable it has a perfumed black currant sherbet nose some slight but enjoyable blueberry grape and prune notes and a soft sweet conclusion. On its own all fine: but it gets lost when in company.
Monarch of the Glen 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,81,12,Aromas of liquid honey light toffee dried apple and satsuma peel. There is an initial citric attack but when the flare dies down a residual bitterness cuts through the underlying creaminess and caramel. Sure its component whiskies lack substance and grip but there is some flavor progression through to an enjoyable piquancy around the gums. The finish is a nippy buzz of peel and heather honey. Simple uncomplicated but for the price there's plenty to like here.
Douglas Laing Scallywag 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,81,75,Douglas Laing follows up its award winning Islay-soaked Big Peat with this a sherried Speyside whisky. Just as Big Peat looks like Captain Haddock from Tintin Scallywag on the label is a dead ringer for Snowy though the official story is different. Anyway this whisky isn't a patch on the Islay monster. Rootsy green salad malt is only partially rescued by the trademark Christmas cake and stewed fruits. Likeable but not a classic. Â£45
Highland Queen 8 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,81,56,At 8 years old there are stiff caramels malt oatcakes Genoise sponge and zested clementines on the nose. It doesn't stint on flavor when it comes to the taste bringing dried fig rolls chewy toffee Aunt Sally pralines walnuts and chocolate ganache to the party. It's driven by dry fruit rather than sweetness and there is a bitter edge to the swallow that persists into the finish.Â Â£35
The Antiquary 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,80,20,This venerable blend has a nose of mandarin syrup cake vanilla cream and cut hay with chopped cilantro and other herbal top notes. Sweet and fruity though verging on tasting of artificial sweeteners at times there are malt notes and a developing butteriness with sweet mandarin notes and sponge cake. It all hangs on a light structure but it's less smooth on the finish with a scratch of wood smoke.
MacQueen's 3 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,80,13,MacQueen's has an impressive range of age statement blends but this is the youngest one. Faint caramel and toast a mild rub of whole spice and snuff tobacco. The mouthfeel is meager and lacks any real punch; there is spice and fudge but little sweetness. More caramel flavors develop alongside chocolate notes before a dry quick finish. There are better options around even at this price.
Islay Mist 8 year old 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,79,24,The nice thing about Islay whiskies is that they often show their true nature better at a younger age. Malty sweet and incredibly herbal (almost gin-like) with emerging tar smoked seaweed and olive. Medicinal in nature with lingering tar and brine on the finish. Fairly straight-forward (what do you expect for 8 years old?) but a pretty decent showing for a whisky this young.
High Commissioner 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,79,15,You're familiar with those generic blended Scotch whiskies of debatable origin with an inoffensive flavor profile right? This isn't one of those. With aromas of the fruit and foliage of an orange grove beeswax and a grassy note this is a juicy citrus-led dram that puffs out in the mouth bringing a tingle of light pepper ginger and thick fudge. Despite the thinner mouthfeel the baked orange and bitter Seville orange on the finish give it some bite. Perfectly serviceable.
Ron Burgundy â€œGreat Odin's Ravenâ€ Special Reserve 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,78,25,What does this say about how far whisky has come? We live in an era where you can now buy the official whisky from a major motion picture. This has a deep amber color. Really deep. The nose brings warm muffins caramel and grassy notes with a good dose of smoke. It's a sweet concoction with a peppery kick. There's a tinge of polypropylene before a short clipped spicy finish. It just needs to find more of its own identity.
Highland Queen 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,78,20,The range begins with this entry-level whisky aged for 3 years. Aromas of pale toffee vanilla and scented herbaceous notes can be found on the nose. It has a light silky texture and comprises flavors of stewed fruits with a slight bitterness behind them. Plum and coffee notes expand though it remains tart through to the buzzy finish which is lifted by hints of chocolate. A robust and pugnacious dram.
MacNaMara Rum Cask Finish 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,78,37,Meaning â€œson of the seaâ€ this MacNaMara has a lilting sweetness that lifts from the glass the characteristic orange-peel oil note is present but less assertive. Nectarine Murray mints and antique shop mustiness but a lot less aromatic than many of its contemporaries. Flavors of sweet melon golden honey and tangy orange take off in the mouth with tastes of white pepper fennel and ground ginger in hot pursuit. Pepperiness penetrates an otherwise juicy finish.
Grand Macnish 150th Anniversary Edition 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,77,18,Robert McNish conceived his recipe for a lighter style of Highland whisky in Glasgow in 1863 (though the brand added an â€˜a' to his surname for easier pronunciation). Whole orange ground hazelnut and ground ginger on the nose though it keeps pretty tight-lipped. Light and sweet in the mouth with mandarin and more pronounced ginger mid-palate before a medium-length finish of bubblegum and gooseberry. It just seems a little uninspiring given the special occasion.
The Lost Distillery Company Auchnagie (batch 2/1) 46%,Blended Scotch Whisky,77,65,Auchnagie (1812â€“1911) was a southern Highland distillery that existed for close to a century near Balluinluig south of Pitlochry. This reanimation is pale yellow in color with an abundance of young green herbal and foliage notes with summer ferns cardamom pods and green tea. It has an ethereal gossamer-like texture with green apple melon boats and soft honey. As the layers peel away the sweetness is dabbed with spices and black pepper before it peters out.
Clansman 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,77,14,This Highland blend has a nose of lemon peel tangerine and pine-scented kitchen surfaces. The whisky is young with a sweet mandarin dressing over the grain character barley sugars and a gentle rumble of spice. What it lacks at this age is mouthfeel structure and wood influence. The finish continues the sugared orange theme with spice and ground pepper fading to soor plooms. For what can be expected at this age the Clansman does its job well.
MacNaMara Blended 40%,Blended Scotch Whisky,76,35,This amber-colored blend from the Gaelic Whisky Company has sweet barley notes and gentle spice aromas. The caramels prop up the dominant flavor of cold-pressed orange oil squeezed from the peel. A crescendo of peppery spice marks the late phase and distinguishes the swallow before a finish of tangy citrus peel with a touch of clove. Perfectly straightforward blend but limited in scope like a linear dot-to-dot connecting barley orange peel and spice.
The Last Drop (distilled at Lochside) 1972 (cask 346) 44%,Grain Scotch Whisky,96,3108,A remarkable beauty from the Angus town of Montrose. The elegant nose shows a dram at peace with itself; golden syrup hay bales ground hazelnut liquid honey French baguette High Mountain oolong and rubbed spice blends. Refreshing palate of honey toffee citrus honeycomb wax and a profusion of sweet vanilla. Rich sweet oak and deep pepper notes to finish. Truly a sublime and venerable grain. (106 bottles) Â£2400
Duncan Taylor (distilled at Invergordon) 40 year old 1965 vintage 49.7%,Grain Scotch Whisky,94,225,A really stunning grain whisky. So rich for a grain whisky with no excessive oak. Lipsmacking notes of vanilla cream coconut custard ripe banana sticky toffee pudding rhum agricole and delicate honeycomb. The flavors are clean deep nicely integrated and complex. Single malt drinkers take note: this whisky will change your opinion of grain whisky forever! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.) 
Exclusive Malts (distilled at Invergordon) 43 year old 1972 48.2%,Grain Scotch Whisky,93,260,This grand old Highlander brings warm flapjacks baked with golden syrup nutmeg oak spices toffee brittle toasted muffin cinnamon sticks and beeswax polish. The oat breakfast cereals and caramel beckon in a fruit explosion of mango burnt orange raspberry banana chips and papaya. Rejoice in that dense ever-changing satin mouthfeel with Invergordon's grain character only more apparent toward the end. Soft spice underplayed on a dry finish. An enchanting find.
Compass Box Hedonism Quindecimus 46%,Grain Scotch Whisky,92,200,How time flies! This eloquent blended grain marks CBWC's 15th anniversary and the combination of these aged grains is idiosyncratic of whisky auteur John Glaser's distinctive taste. Rich honey apricot stone crisp spices vanilla custard gentle oak char and tropical fruits promise a real reward. Succulently juicy with melon apple and caramel subtly paced with chocolate and dark fruit infiltrating. Slowly the sweetness depletes to black pepper and spiced roast meats. Defer swallowing for as long as possible. (5689 bottles)
Compass Box Hedonism Maximus,Grain Scotch Whisky,90,300,An older more exotic expression of Hedonism consisting of 42 year old Invergordon and 29 year old Cameron Bridge grain whiskies. Straw gold color. This is richer and cleaner than most other grain whisky offerings which are often too thin and overweight with dry oak. Like many older grain whiskies creamy vanilla coconut custard and a variety of tropical fruits abound. Additional notes of toasted marshmallow caramelized apricot golden raisin and a gentle dried spice finish add complexity. Surely one of the better examples of this rather eccentric category.
Scott's Selection (Distilled at 'North of Scotland') 1964 Vintage 45.5%,Grain Scotch Whisky,90,140,According to the Christie family who owned North of Scotland Distillery before it was sold to DCL in 1982 (and closed it shortly thereafter) they would purchase the least expensive grain possible to make their grain whisky. In 1964 it was barley. The barley combined with the fact that the whisky is finished off in port casks makes for a surprisingly rich sweet and fruity grain whisky expressing notes of demerara sugar perfumed candles cherry almond tart caramel and vanilla. Remarkably restrained wood notes for such a mature whisky which expresses itself mostly in its soft creamy finish. Unique among whiskies. 
That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at North British) 27 year old 56.3%,Grain Scotch Whisky,90,51,This slippery little rogue exudes sweet popcorn lemon peel summer florals linseed and Quaker Oats pillows adrift in a sea of butterscotch sauce. Rather tasty; the cask strength alcohol rips through the juicy mandarin and toffee opening overcoming an active peppery middle section then relinquishing its grip to leave herbal notes corn and fudge. Reverberating lengthy toffee and spice finish. Water brings out more cereal notes and soft orange.
Douglas Laing Xtra Old Particular (distilled at Strathclyde) 40 year old 55.4%,Grain Scotch Whisky,90,390,This is an amazing link back to Glasgow in the 1970s. Fresh peach cherry blossom red Tunes baked apple hay bales acetone orange peel and old pepper grinders. A silky texture with red apple orange oils and a luxuriantly refined taste leads to apple peelings caramel and ginger. Such quality! The finish slips away quietly: melon peach fudge and a final twist of pepper. Bliss! Great to see Douglas Laing bringing out more XOP single grains of such standing. (150 bottles)
The Exceptional Grain 43%,Grain Scotch Whisky,89,100,The debut release from Don Sutcliffe's Sutcliffe & Sons this small-batch blend of grain whiskies comes from several different distilleries including Loch Lomond North British and a 30 year old whisky from Carsebridge. The blend is married in first-fill sherry casks which brings bright fruit to a fairly light whisky with notes of blackberry vanilla honey light oak and iris. Quite good for a grain whisky blend but falls just short of being exceptional. (U.S. only)
The Clan Denny Single Grain (distilled at Cambus) 35 year old 54.2%,Grain Scotch Whisky,88,190,Very typical of old grain whiskies: light in body and floral with soothing vanilla and a mÃ©lange of tropical fruit (mandarin in syrup honey-kissed pineapple banana and coconut cream). The better examples like this one are not dominated by dry oak on the finish. Subtle spices (ginger cocoa powder) add intrigue. Old grain whiskies are hard to find but worth exploring. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)
The Clan Denny (distilled at Strathclyde) 9 year old 55.7%,Grain Scotch Whisky,88,75,Need more whisky? Of course you do! Try this then. It was matured in a sherry butt following distillation in 2005: savory beefy roasted meat juices brisket bark balsamic vinegar new strips of colored plasticine and chocolatey Guatemalan coffee beans. A sherried soft and wispy opener with a whiff of ginger clove plum charred notes raisins and black bun: this youngster can handle itself alright. A cloying clingy finish with heat sweet sherry notes and spices. Give it plenty!
That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Invergordon) 43 year old 47.7%,Grain Scotch Whisky,88,108,Like a throwback to childhood: fruity lollipops Love Hearts and gobstoppers. Stewed apple crusty bread and dry roasted coriander seeds add more dimension to the nose. The palate has toffee orange peel dates and briefly flirts with chocolate and coffee though this grain has mouth-drawing astringency and savory spices to balance the sweetness. Long finish of aniseed spiced dark toffee and charred oak.
Compass Box Hedonism 43%,Grain Scotch Whisky,87,62,Gold color. Delicate aromas of tropical fruits (coconut pineapple mango) marshmallow and vanilla. Light in body with delicate exotic flavors that deliver what the aroma promises. Soft gentle delicately creamy finish.
Compass Box Last Vatted Grain 46%,Grain Scotch Whisky,87,199,Bottled as London's Big Ben began to strike midnight on the day that the word 'vatted' was outlawed in Scotch whisky terminology this is a mix of grains from different distilleries and does the campaign for more Scotch grain whisky no harm at all.  Gossamer soft and smooth with a honeycomb heart and milk chocolate vanilla and the odd prod of spice it's a cushion of a whisky. Luxurious indulgent and well made. Â£125 
Scott's Selection (distilled at 'North of Scotland') 1963 46.8%,Grain Scotch Whisky,87,120,Antique gold. Thought-provoking aromas and flavors of molasses leather vanilla and wood spices with a hint of bourbon and rum. Light to medium in body. Given that this whisky is so mature and rather light in body it has held up very well-the woody dryness is balanced nicely by the sweetness of the grain. 
That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Invergordon) 42 year old 47.7%,Grain Scotch Whisky,87,106,Rich notes of baking chocolate compacted dry earth runny caramel and garam masala highlight the versatility of aromas between these expressions. Chocolate digestive biscuits plain chocolate nibs caramel a hit of mouth-puckering pepper and chili heat but the chocolate endures. A zinging finish akin to Tache spiced bark.
Master of Malt Single Cask Series (distilled at Loch Lomond) 18 year old 60.5%,Grain Scotch Whisky,86,135,The strength is immediately apparent though the nose has a curious mix of potato chips tarragon salt and fizzy sherbet. The palate is more fruity quite syrupy and sugary with a lift of honeycomb and spicy ginger. It develops spiced orange notes lime soft summer fruits vanilla and Milka chocolate encased in a thick dense mouthfeel with nutmeg dried peel and powdered chocolate. A rumbustious dram at cask strength but when tamed it coaxes out ginger-sprinkled papaya and mango. (96 bottles)Â Â£89
Berry Bros. & Rudd Exceptional Casks (distilled at North British) 50 year old 58.9%,Grain Scotch Whisky,86,763,Drawn from a pair of casks filled back in 1962 this brings out dried mango strips white chocolate melon honeysuckle and light vanilla with pepper and cumin around the fringes. Plenty to explore. Maple syrup flavors with plenty of thick tannins but its vitality is intact. Darker verging on bitter notes appear later on as it melds into rootsy funky territory with burnt butter deep vanilla treacle and spiced coffee. More wood with dry nuttiness on the finish. Leave off the water.Â Â£500
Lonach (distilled at Carsebridge) 1063 vintage 43 year old 43%,Grain Scotch Whisky,85,115,A rare bottling indeed from this now defunct grain distillery. Very tropical with a macaroon and vanilla cream foundation. Complementary notes of marshmallow crÃ¨me brulee honey and pineapple. Surprisingly vibrant for a 43 year old whisky and while expressing sweeter notes not at all cloying (the grain whisky aspects actually help here). Soothing and distinctive. Great price too!
That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Cambus) 24 year old 49.7%,Grain Scotch Whisky,85,62,Nearly a quarter of a century since Cambus Distillery closed select casks are still being bottled by the independents. Grapefruit peel fruit teas lemon zest mixed spice cardamom and wild garlic make for an intriguing nose. A sweet taste of sugared almonds lemon bonbons strands of candied peel bananas and vanilla before the spices stomp all over the sweetness. Hot dry spicy finish with just a lick of butterscotch.
That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Caledonian) 29 year old 47.7%,Grain Scotch Whisky,84,74,As young a Caledonian as you'll find; I found the nose rather underdeveloped. Crystallized lemon slices green banana solvents dry grasses and a sniff of nail polish remover. In the mouth lemon flavors saccharine sweet honey and banana dipped in melted chocolate while the alcohol nips at the tongue. A good trajectory redeems its character leaving deep throbbing spice notes in the finish with bitter citrus at the fringes.
That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Invergordon) 25 year old 49.8%,Grain Scotch Whisky,84,49,More typical grain whisky territory here with a nose of cornflakes fresh cream cut grass filaments of orange peel and a curiously dull pepper note. Spice sweetness and citrus fight for dominance. Spice wins with a K.O. on sweetness and lays the citrus out cold on the canvas. Creamy chocolate notes tarnished with hot pepper on the finish though coffee-pot flavors emerge with a dash of water.
Wemyss Malts Vintage Strawberry Punnet (distilled at Invergordon) 1988 46%,Grain Scotch Whisky,83,125,I'm playfully perplexed as to whether the titular â€œvintageâ€ refers to an elderly strawberry or an aged punnet. Undaunted this example from the Highland powerhouse noses much better than promised with fresh mint small tight strawberry buds sandy loam and a saccharine sweetness. It has a sweet syrupy fat flavor in turn revealing caramel buttery notes white chocolate vanilla and black currant. A satisfying finish of browning butter and warm chestnuts. (242 bottles)Â Â£82
Duncan Taylor (distilled at Invergordon) Cask #15517 41 year old 50.2% ,Grain Scotch Whisky,81,200,Some of these older Duncan Taylor grain whiskies are very individualistic and exciting. With others the wood has gotten the best of them (Grain whiskies are light in body and thus vulnerable to excessive oak aging). This one fortunately gravitates more towards the former with a rather reserved oak influence given its age. A bit tight on the nose. Rather sweet too and somewhat viscous. Notes of vanilla crÃ¨me brulee marzipan caramel-coated popcorn brown sugar toasted coconut and subtle pineapple and papaya. A gentle dried spice finish rescues the whisky from all the sweetness.
Clan Denny (distilled at Girvan) 20 year old 56.7%,Grain Scotch Whisky,81,134,Scooped-out spaghetti squash whole red bird's eye chilies celery tops and country ham. It is redolent of sugary-sweet candies like Spangles (from the 1970s). Light and delicate initially moving into phases of vanilla sponge dried raspberry and peppery spices then the vegetal notes grow larger in the later phases. An enjoyable effort from refill cask #10439 but it fizzles out leaving a finish of light pepperiness heat and sodden newspapers.Â Â£88
Darkness! (distilled at Invergordon) 23 year old 50.8%,Grain Scotch Whisky,81,117,Cometh the night. Shadows veil a whisky hewn from the cold lands in the north. A whisky of black cherry crÃ¨me de prune rancio balsamic and salt for it has known a mythical chimera cask; half Pedro XimÃ©nez half oloroso wood. The magical syrupy texture foretells of passion fruit fig cherry and raisins but prophesizes that cask char will dominate the swallow. Dark forces swamp the quest for grain though there is taste hope and nourishment for the journey ahead.Â Â£77
That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at North British; batch 2) 49.3%,Grain Scotch Whisky,78,95,Papier mÃ¢chÃ© adhesives lemongrass green cardamom peanut pear and other aromatic fruity characteristics create a puzzling aroma profile. On sipping there is fruity baked apple sherbet and glowing light citrus notes of orange grapefruit and lime with a medium weight structure. The flavors tip toward a slight sour fruit note but as this flattens out creaminess rules. The finish suffers a short quick death leaving mild sour fruit. Water brings crystallized lemon on the nose and sweeter light fruits.Â Â£63
Duncan Taylor (distilled at Cameronbridge) Cask #3583 28 year old 54.4%,Grain Scotch Whisky,72,125,Its best attributes are vanilla toasted coconut and tropical fruit but the rest of this grain whisky is a bit of a disappointment. It is thin and at times harsh. A paint thinner component is evident (especially on the nose) along with more wood on the finish than this thin body can handle. Two Carsebridge grain Scotch whiskies from Duncan Taylor which I have tasted recently were much better: richer and creamier and with more balance.
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Carsebridge) 33 year old 1982 45.4%,Single Grain Whisky,93,100,You little beauty! Maple syrup pecan sliced peach and vanilla-laden bread-and-butter pudding. Soft baked-apple tart smooth sticky toffee pudding red apples oozing with caramels and a fine layer of spice. The mouthfeel is silky rounded and effortlessly elegant. Finish of walnut clove and marron glacÃ©. Douglas Laing has brought out some amazing grains lately but this is better than ever. (K&L Wines exclusive 233 bottles
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Cambus) 25 year old 1991 62%,Single Grain Whisky,92,80,A single cask from a refill hoggie this bursts with vanilla fudge cracked peppercorn wood shavings and apple strudel. Incredibly fruity with mouth-watering gummy bears tangy orange and dried pineapple evolving from sweet fruits through to banana chews. Diluting down from its considerable cask strength only pumps up the juiciness. To conclude a long creamy finish like a banana shake. Evidently terrific cask selection at work. (K&L Wines exclusive 246 bottles)
Exclusive Malts (distilled at Cameronbridge) 1984 33 year old 51.2%,Single Grain Whisky,92,225,Top notes of hay honey and caramel over a spicy core pulsating with pepper rye spiced Quaker Oats and freshly planed wood. An epic battle ensues: round after round of citrus vs. spice both growing stronger as they slug it out; jabs of sweetness meet a chastisingly nippy right hook until eventually exhausted both protagonists drop their guard. Dry crackling spice and sugared almonds run through a mighty long finish.
The Sovereign (distilled at Cambus) 30 year old 1984 49.4%,Single Grain Whisky,92,152,The nose is bathed in aromas of lime bergamot lychee and fresh pineapple cores. This is delicate refined and complex with touches of fragrant spices and a calming influence of oak. A web of citrus strands barley sugar and toffee is shot through by wood spices and surpassed by a delicious butterscotch flavor that continues into the finish.Â  Effortless relaxed and brilliant whisky and quite frankly I'm not sure you could find better 30 year old whisky at this price. Â£106
Duncan Taylor Rare Auld (distilled at Girvan) 1974 40 year old 53.7%,Single Grain Whisky,92,450,This is an assured release one not trying to be anything other than beautiful old grain whisky. Caramel aged oak rose petals and dried heather twigs with touches of sweetness. The palate has a lovely substantial feel to it the strength quite apparent with soft sweet toffees fleeting citrus and grapefruit then aniseed tugging at your tongue. The finish is a gum-numbing sweet decay of fading oaky memories. (78 bottles)
The Five Distinguished and Rare 39 year old 51%,Single Grain Whisky,92,216,This is massive. It even pours thickly as the aromas spill out of the glass: rich stewed apple dry oak a passing digestif trolley wobbling with dark sticky bottles and currants on the tummy of a gingerbread man. There is a rum-like quality to the thick texture that lands squarely on the palate bursting out with sweet apple and brown sugar. It hardly loses its grip after swallowing dissipating almost imperceptibly against the approaching oak flavors. Special indeed. (330 bottles WoodWinters Wines & Whiskies only) Â£150
The Sovereign (distilled at Cambus) 50 year old 1964 49.2%,Single Grain Whisky,91,657,You really don't see many of these. Pear drops stewed apple strawberry jam fragrant rhubarb stems and vanilla pods. Neat there's a tacky sweetness of hard candy with bitter skins of damson and green plum sloes and custard creams. Counteract this with water to bring out acetone cake mix and sweet bourbon notes of vanilla and creamed coconut. Then it is triumphant. Dry oak and dark vanilla complete one of the longest finishes I've savored this year. (111 bottles)Â Â£420
Port Dundas 52 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017) 44.6%,Single Grain Whisky,90,900,This 1964 distillate has a nose of rich toffee weighty oak allspice antique hardback books dried apple cracker bread and banana chips. A fairy tale taste of red apple perfection as if Snow White polished it on her skirt. This ripens to encompass gumdrops and lollipops. Golden syrup lime zest caramel and vanilla bleed into a conclusion of nutmeg oak and apple peel. An auspicious moment for grain whisky. (752 bottles)
The Sovereign (distilled at Dumbarton) 50 year old 1964 43.8%,Single Grain Whisky,90,453,Incredible! This dark golden dram was distilled in the same year that the Beatles first played in America. An aromatic nose of fruit spangles gentle acetone clove eucalyptus vanilla pods and tamarind. Soft gentle apple flavors with a silky texture; sweet orange vanilla ginger spice and raspberry. The oak is mouth-puckering unless you add water (and you can). A finish of Starburst chews although a soft presence slowly drying from the oak. Simply gorgeous experiential whisky. (93 bottles)Â Â£290
Caledonian â€˜The Cally' 1974 40 year old 53.3%,Single Grain Whisky,90,1200,If your glass is half empty you might overlook this because it is the most expensive single grain Scotch whisky released to date. If your glass is half full you will relish sweet toffee popcorn coconut fresh fruits linseed oil and some spicy and nutty notes. Makes sense as South African white maize was heavily used in the production in the early 1970s. It's mouth filling dark and brooding with plenty of chocolate oak tannins char and layered spice. Sumptuous. (5060 bottles)
The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Invergordon) 30 year old 1984 (cask #8005) 52.3%,Single Grain Whisky,89,220,A rare old single grain whisky from Scotland's most northern grain distillery. The nose brings together varnished oak clove dried orange peel and molasses. On the palate an unexpectedly lush mouthfeel supports a flavorful combination of citrus molasses and varnished oak. This single grain has depth and character that's completely uncommon to the category tasting a lot more like an aged rum. A long acidic slightly sour dry and spicy finish rounds out a unique and intriguing whisky. (U.S. only)
Cambus 40 year old 52.7%,Single Grain Whisky,89,1150,The oldest of the 2016 Diageo Special Releases distilled in 1975 then rested in refill American hogsheads. The initial nose is slightly balsamic with green tea ripe eating apples and developing vanilla. Creamy on the palate with big vanilla custard notes white pepper and dates. Relatively short in the finish with soft spices and mild oak. No negative tannins despite its age. (1812 bottles)
Girvan Patent Still 30 year old 42%,Single Grain Whisky,89,549,The senior member of the Girvan range is very approachable with a gorgeous nose like a hay meadow on a summer's morning while sucking honey-lemon lozenges. The fruitiness has mellowed ripened and softened with the extra aging. A thick luscious layered dram of toffee banana sparkling orange peel wood spices ripe fruits and banoffee pie lead to a mouth-coating conclusion of shimmering spiciness. This will fill you with joy and satisfaction. Grain can be this good.5
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Strathclyde) 27 year old 1988 57.9%,Single Grain Whisky,89,128,This example is more assertive than the Strathclyde 1987 (see below) but with a better defined grain character. Peeled plum skins Christmas spices and honey. Well-balanced yet intense it feels packed with potential. Warming with dried orange peel a big wave of ginger spice dried apple and mango ensure sufficient sweetness to swamp the acidic tendencies of the citrus. The spices rattle around the mouth for some considerable time colliding with the dry citrus. (198 bottles) Â£89
Loch Lomond 46%,Single Grain Whisky,88,29,A rare beast of 100% malted barley mash distilled in a Coffey still. Dried grasses butterscotch toffee honey spread across hot toast fresh green apples custard creams and peppercorns leap from the glass. From the sweet apple lemon orange and honey it fleshes out with toffee apple sweet vanilla and cinnamon stick concluding with a little more grain character and spice on the finish. Delicious stuff!
Wemyss Malt Caribbean CrÃ¨me (distilled at Invergordon) 1988 46%,Single Grain Whisky,88,124,A divine lilting nose of exotic summery fruits that brings a smile to your face. Split papaya fleshy mango and candied peel join freshly squeezed OJ and sugar-dusted marshmallows. The thick syrupy texture fizzes attractively on the palate with flavors of warm marmalade on buttered granary toast. After some mid-palate heat there is flavored sherbet candy mint and burnt orange on the finish. Fruity but happily not sugary sweet like some grains. (171 bottles for Europe and Asia)Â Â£85
The Sovereign (distilled at Cambus) 40 year old 1975 57.7%,Single Grain Whisky,88,297,This potent grain whisky from a refill hoggie bears ripe pears green apples vanilla sugar polished horse chestnuts and a waft of acetone. Neat there is sweet fudge runny caramels and heat but natural dilution dissipates the sweetness to boiled candy with faint cocoa. At this strength it really takes water generously illuminating fruitiness and softening the heat. Dry sweet vanilla pricked with orange seals the finish. There's a sweet spot where this is deliciously drinkable. (114 bottles)Â Â£190
Clan Denny (distilled at Strathclyde) 27 year old 1988 55%,Single Grain Whisky,88,127,We get off on the wrong foot with that vegetal note common to certain Strathclyde bottlings. It quickly blows over to release candied lemon and orange slices fresh-baked honey biscuits eucalyptus clove and eventually some fresh breath mints. Divinely sweet orange and lemon puddings caramelized sugars close to burning and soor plooms. Despite the lemon sweetness at the fringes there remains a central core of mint and clove. Sherbet lemons fizz on the tongue to finish. All is forgiven. Â£88
Girvan Patent Still 25 year old 42%,Single Grain Whisky,88,422,William Grant is making pioneering efforts to develop Girvan as a single grain whisky brand with more to come. The aromas beckon with masses of buttery vanilla notes fresh apple cinnamon stick bundles dark peel and chocolate pralines. The creamy unctuous texture packs in white chocolate citrus lime chewy caramels and pineapple with soft American oak characteristics. Long finish of vanilla ground cinnamon and mint. One of the tastiest grains on the market: expensive but still it's patently very good.Â Â£250
The Sovereign (distilled at Port Dundas) 26 year old 1988 52.1%,Single Grain Whisky,88,141,You can feel the power taut and straining underneath the sweet nose of powdered sugar sliced banana in custard packing straw from tea chests apple fritters and sweet oak. There's instant gratification as this colossal whisky is fit to burst with honey tropical fruits apple melon and strawberry candy. Water adds shafts of sweetness to the nose and more jamminess to the palate. Made in Glasgow in the fall of 1988 and delivered at perfect drinking strength: they've bottled sunshine. (154 bottles)Â Â£90
The Sovereign (distilled at Dumbarton) 1964 50 year old 49.1%,Single Grain Whisky,88,548,Rosewater polished antique oak furniture nail polish remover and clove on the nose. It's fruit forward compared to other aged examples from this closed distillery; the spiced apple and baked plum are partnered by peppery heat and chili ginger and fleeting hints of coffee and cocoa. The flavors throb out of this one producing a long-lasting experience ending with a dry finish of soft fruits and ginger. A splash of water coaxes out nougat and makes the spices behave. (162 bottles) Â£380
Wemyss Malts (distilled at Invergordon) Mocha Moment 1988 46%,Single Grain Whisky,87,127,A rather moreish grain and Wemyss certainly nailed the chocolate orange aromas on the nose here. Bright bursts of rich orange and comforting milk chocolate accompany gentle underlying spices star anise treacle-drizzled hams and Godiva mint pearls. The palate is easygoing with chocolate muffins condensed milk dates and milky Coco Pops. There is oak but it's never obtrusive and of course cold mocha that fades slowly until the moment has passed. (240 bottles)Â Â£102
Clan Denny (distilled at Port Dundas) 1992 21 year old HH9452 55.7%,Single Grain Whisky,87,108,There's little quality Port Dundas being bottled so don't pass up the opportunity for this one. It evokes aromas of grated milk chocolate grilled pancakes apricot mango and poached pear Jell-O with spice notes of ground cumin cinnamon and nutmeg. This is simply delicious: a honey pot of sticky sweetness. A rich cask strength grain whisky with notes of mandarin and candied jellies. A dash of water enables the sweet creamy flavors to swirl around the mouth.Â Â£64
Girvan Patent Still Proof Strength 57.1%,Single Grain Whisky,87,110,Apples squeezed in a cider press sherbet Dib Dabs and cinnamon sticks comprise the nose of this west coast grain whisky. It's lip-tingling at cask strength; the lemon and molten honey tussling with the effervescence of the Dib Dabs before golden syrup pours over the tongue. It's like crunching through a packet of powdery Love Hearts erupting in the mouth. Water encourages peach fondant French fancies flavors with a slightly pushy fruit skin note at the finish.Â Â£75
Douglas Laing Xtra Old Particular (distilled at Garnheath) 41 year old 1974 48.9%,Single Grain Whisky,87,277,Mid-period Garnheath here the distillery existing for barely 20 years. This brings aromas of freshly ground pepper oils soft fudge and dry monkey nut shells. The fudge is smothered by spices exploding in the mouth: ginger nutmeg pepper and cinnamon. Warm toffees oak and citrus emerge late but boy this dram has great stamina and length. Sure the finish has an oakiness slight sourness and a gentle spicy pepperiness but water subtracts more than it gains. A genuine rarity. (141 bottles)Â Â£222
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Girvan) 27 year old 1988 62.6%,Single Grain Whisky,86,124,Buttery croissants golden honey peach stone rye cracker bread royal icing vanilla essence and dry oak. It's sweet and sticky with icing sugar and yellow fruits before a scorching alcohol burn kicks in lasting 30 seconds. It settles down to banana custard and vanilla becoming tangy with candied peel Turkish delight and Edinburgh rock. The gum-tingling finish evaporates quickly. Carefulâ€”water disables the flavors all too easily though adds some toasty spice and warmth. (192 bottles) Â£96
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Port Dundas) 26 year old 1990 51.9%,Single Grain Whisky,86,80,Can it really be six years since the distillery closed and they demolished the chimney stack? This nose has a much stronger grain character than the other two Old Particular releases so one to try before you buy. Beach driftwood and toasted spice aromas with flavors of warm butterscotch mandarin and peach on a peppery base shuffling into dried fruits and muscovado sugar before a spicy nougat finish. This is hardcore. (K&L Wines exclusive 243 bottles)
The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Port Dundas) 25 year old 1991 53.6%,Single Grain Whisky,86,175,Vanilla ice cream drizzled in caramel and speared with a couple of wafers. Ground hazelnut faint dashes of cinnamon and garam masala complete the nose. A brief opener of rich toffee and tangy citrus is overrun with a piquant acidic rush and nippy alcohol flare. It's actually light in texture and a largely absorbing experience ending on some dusty marshmallow notes though never losing the tanginess. Water accentuates the tangerine and mandarin but negates the mallow candy flavors. (264 bottles)
Signatory Cask Strength Collection (distilled at Cambus) 22 year old 1991 53.8%,Single Grain Whisky,86,110,The closed grain distillery niche is small but Cambus rightly has its followers. The latest in a series of sequential cask releases from Signatory this refill butt signals a grassy nose of green hay bales tangerine potting compost white pepper and almond-studded nougat. To drink it's like joyously biting into a tangerine marshmallow to be rewarded with thick cloudy puffs of flavor with a peppery accompaniment.Â  Dabble with the water to reveal the delights of orange creamsicle pie.Â Â£65
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Cameronbridge) 25 year old 1990 60.6%,Single Grain Whisky,86,119,This refill butt has produced a perfumed and aromatic whisky with peach green foliage maize a spritz of melon juice and a pinch of ground cinnamon and nutmeg rubbed between the fingers. It's zingy! Ginger sears the lips before the warmth of the ginger invades the mouth. The satin texture of honey and vanilla concludes with Spangles before it enters a long mouth-coating finish of sweet ginger. With water soft ripe fruit abounds; the ginger harmonizes rather than attacks. (282 bottles) Â£83
Signatory (distilled at Cameronbridge) 1995 43%,Single Grain Whisky,85,44,A pale grain from the colossal Fife distillery released at 18 years old as part of Signatory's Vintage Single Grain Collection. Vanilla icing digestive biscuits pumpernickel toasted coconut flakes crushed cumin seed and a background note of fresh mint are apparent. The vanilla and blossom honey flavors are in union with the buttery lightweight texture and there's a pulsating spiciness that lives on in the finish. A refreshing alternative.Â Â£26
The Sovereign (distilled at North British) 25 year old 57.5%,Single Grain Whisky,85,80,Green grapes fresh apple caramel wood spices cinnamon nutmeg and digestive biscuits show the freshness of this quarter-century dram. Before the alcohol grips sweet corn flavors and acidic-citrus fruitiness present themselves (a North British characteristic). A pleasurable thick-textured taste of cookie dough lime lemon orange Jell-o and oak spices. A sparkling citrus finish dances on the tip of the tongue. Water discharges the taste of artificial sweeteners so buck up and take it as it comes. (K&L Wines Exclusive)
Wemyss Malts Rosy Apple BrÃ»lÃ©e  (distilled at Invergordon) 1988  46%,Single Grain Whisky,84,115,Perfect for fall; like strolling through an orchard polishing a windfall apple before crunching into its juicy fruit. Nose of caramel dry worked wood banana chips cinnamon and Indian spices. The palate is warming with apple juice backed by a slowly growing spice note later caramels and a slight oxidized apple and brown peel note to end. The finish has a mildly bitter apple tinge and buzzing spices. The apple sings out with a dash of water. (494 bottles) Â£89
Douglas Laing Xtra Old Particular (distilled at Carsebridge) 50 year old 1965 40.1%,Single Grain Whisky,84,345,This was distilled the year before Carsebridge joined Scottish Grain Distillers under Distillers Company Limited (DCL). It brings a nose of toasted muffins whole lemon light honey vanilla pencil shavings and a slight herbal hit. Smooth thick and viscous with light lemon honey gentle spices peach melba and toffee. The finish is silky and mouth-coating; rich and luxuriant. A venerable pleasant old grain but it lacks the zing to become truly exceptional and distinctive. (101 bottles) Â£267
The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Strathclyde) 26 year old 1988 (cask #62016) 55.1%,Single Grain Whisky,84,180,An uncommon 26 year Lowland single grain whisky made from wheat and aged in refill bourbon casks. Oak is quite present on the nose but it's not alone: there's also bright citrus pine and white cake. The opening is softer with vanilla and apricot but it's only a brief respite before a very spicy mid-palate focused around oak and white pepper. There is a fair amount of fire from the alcohol which drives a very spicy and dry finish. (U.S. only)
Port Dundas 18 year old 43%,Single Grain Whisky,84,100,This is a little darker in color than its younger counterpart (see below) although it is achieved without the complex recipe of different cask maturation that characterized the 2011 Special Releases bottling. Weetabix hazelnut shells and the aroma of warm pretzels from a street vendor waft out of the glass. It's a soft silky wheat-flavored whisky that reaches into dark toffee and nutty territory. Imagine a molten toffee crisp if you like. A nougat and walnut-whip finish. Distinctively different.
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Girvan) 25 year old 1989 51.5%,Single Grain Whisky,84,117,From the most westerly grain distillery in Scotland comes this wee charmer offering coconut fondant galia melon fresh cream and a pleasing fragrant foliage note (walking through dense reed beds in early summer). A big juicy dram with citrus tropical fruits and dabs of white pepper heat. The creaminess builds as dilution occurs then it reaches a natural plateau and hits cruise. An intensely tangy and long finish of dried fruits. (232 bottles) Â£81
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at North British) 27 year old 1988 50.2%,Single Grain Whisky,84,122,Drawn from a single refill barrel the nose is like a day in the life of a honeybee: streams of pollen rich nectar heady scents of flying over bright summer flowers and summer picnics of white peaches and lemonade before returning to the hive to the sweet sticky honey. It's quite a buzz! There's an acidic palate of lemon juice lime honey and lemon pith bordering on bitterness. The finish is incredibly dry like someone just invented lemon-scented sandpaper. (168 bottles) Â£85
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Strathclyde) 27 year old 1987 51.5%,Single Grain Whisky,84,124,Creamy vanilla fresh-cut grass gentle herbal notes Murray mints and the warm newsprint wrappers of fish and chips on the coast (in a lovely comforting way). The cereals provide a sweet biscuit note butterscotch candy gingersnaps and a nip of aniseed. The outturn of cask #10804 its taste develops with dried orange peel cookie dough and vanilla. Quite scrumptious! Fading slowly it leaves behind gentle spices and syrup-drizzled popcorn. (198 bottles) Â£86
Exclusive Regions Single Grain (distilled at North British) 10 year old 50%,Single Grain Whisky,84,55,The nose has a conspicuous grain quality to it like a bouquet of flowers in a nail salon. In addition to acetone there is orange fondant and the smell of new Legos. Soft marshmallow and orange cream dilute to strawberry candy soft peaches and pineapple but it's all swept aside by a Tabasco jackhammer that ricochets between the tongue and palate. Finish of Gatorade fruit punch and ginger root. (246 bottles)
Master of Malt Single Cask Series (distilled at North British) 18 year old 52.3%,Single Grain Whisky,83,100,A tasty example from the historic North British distillery in Edinburgh with a bouquet of vanilla sweet hay and mint ice cream. A sip made me nostalgic for childhood candies such as sherbet-filled fizzy flying saucers and prohibited ivory-white candy sticks. I was seized by the initial lemon zing of acidic tartness which becomes creamier before a richer candied peel taste appears. There's a clean sweet finish and the mint pops up with water. Overall satisfying but uncomplicated.
The Sovereign (distilled at Cambus) 26 year old 1988 46.9%,Single Grain Whisky,83,142,A light golden dram from a refill hoggie redolent of fragrant honey custard slices orange water perfumed soaps and fresh spring blossom. Vanilla dried peel and shortbread petticoat tails on the palate that develops with spun sugar flavors. The whole concoction is anchored by a little oak but the cask has been gentle. The finish is mouth-drawing but settles down like a well-sucked butterscotch. Mellow and serene. (305 bottles)Â Â£91
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Invergordon) 28 year old 1987 56.5%,Single Grain Whisky,83,110,Sweet top notes of brioche loaf with baking spices but there are savory flavors of pastrami bark lurking deep in the glass. Flavors of golden syrup and butterscotch unfurl beautifully from within the thick texture at cask strength. Roasted spices explode but as it dilutes stewed fruits and sucked boiled candy notes are found. Water emphasizes confectionary elements and purple fruits but kills the spices stone dead. Dry spicy heat on the finish. (490 bottles) Â£85
Old Particular (distilled at Girvan) 25 year old 1990 51.5%,Single Grain Whisky,83,126,This refill barrel is perhaps more suited to those well versed in drinking grains regularly. The nose is herbal with tarragon endive leaves and artichoke hearts though there is balance from oat biscuits and honey. The palate begins clean and pure builds complexity with vegetal notes and honey sweetness before delivering flavors of dates nougat wheat crackers and dry toasted spices. The drying finish has Quaker oats and sizzling spices. An acquired taste this one but not without merit. (162 bottles) Â£87
Strathclyde 12 year old 62.1%,Single Grain Whisky,82,73,An official Strathclyde from Chivas Bros. presented in its squat bottle from their under-appreciated Cask Strength Edition series. I found a peculiar nose comprising shafts of lemongrass garlic bulb root ginger taffy candy and green tea. As an Iron Dram it's oily and bold with coconut fresh mint and green pea with a savory note tugging at the taste buds. Dilution highlights scallions a light creamy toffee and Reese's peanut butter cups. Curiously intriguing: for bold flavor explorers only.Â Â£43
Port Dundas 12 year old 40%,Single Grain Whisky,82,50,It's been four years since Diageo last released an official single grain whisky from this Glasgow distillery. This will kick off your evening with its aromas of golden syrup flapjacks light vanilla sponge fingers and waxy linseeds. The American oak notes are all over this: vanilla sweet granola and pecan yet there is a squeeze of lemon and a square of milk chocolate too. The creamy finish has real length and makes this a most accessible grain whisky.
Old Particular (distilled at Cambus) 27 year old 51.5%,Single Grain Whisky,82,126,Oh boy! It's like tearing open a warm banana-and-toffee muffin the steam bringing the moist sweet goodness to your nostrils. Roasted peach and neat orange cordial join the party. On the palate the alcohol strength is noticeably strong with flavors of red currant cranberry and black pepper. At the fruitier end of the Cambus spectrum this concludes with a whimper of spices leading to a nip of cinnamon and bitter vanilla in the tail. (270 bottles) Â£87
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at North British) 21 year old 50.9%,Single Grain Whisky,81,109,Did you hear that this distillery produced its 2.5 billionth liter of alcohol in 2015? This example from a refill hoggie has a floral bouquet with a nose of snapped fingers of vanilla shortbread butter frosting and Angel Delight. An oily texture with flavors reminiscent of popcorn turns to caramel vanilla parkin and gingersnaps. There are some growling base notes of peppercorn but it ends on a singed popcorn note. Sticky nougat and toasted corn chips on the finish. (294 bottles) Â£76
Clan Denny (distilled at Girvan) 21 year old 1993 51.8%,Single Grain Whisky,80,117,Unmistakably grainy in character this offers aromas of pink lemonade Dubble Bubble faint vanilla confectioner's sugar and mild herbal tones. Its redeeming qualities are the good thick texture and creamy buttery feeling in the mouth. Sparkling orange and processed raspberry and strawberry flavors are hit by a surge of pepper and clove which subsides to allow some late herbal notes to creep in. The finish has a heavy clove note. File this as a grain enthusiast's grain whisky. Â£81
The Sovereign (distilled at Port Dundas) 25 year old 1990 51.9%,Single Grain Whisky,80,119,Vicks inhaler (menthol camphor and pine needle oil) freshly unwrapped sticks of spearmint gum cilantro and root ginger make for a stimulating if not exactly charming olfactory experience. Mouth-filling and structured with good weight this has sweet orange and a mild gingery glow. Although there are fleeting vegetal notes it stays just sweet of the middle. Close heat on the finish saturating the taste buds with spice and dark citrus. Â£83
The Sovereign (distilled at Invergordon) 50 year old 42.9%,Single Grain Whisky,80,300,You can smell the time that has elapsed on this dark chestnut dram. Glimpses of vanilla essence mushroom gills blueberries aged balsamic vinegar and beef stock. Flavors swirl around charred meat juices walnut oil chewed leather rancio tobacco leaf tree bark black toffee and licorice root. A slight creamy salvation tugs it from its oaky and savory comfort zone. The moderate finish is awash with Brazil nut and bitter coffee grounds. Forget about adding water. An ancient fragile grain whisky. (K&L Wines exclusive)
Borders 51.7%,Single Grain Whisky,80,72,A single grain whisky made equally from wheat and barley to keep you amused until R&B Distillers builds their new distilleries. The first impression created by the oloroso cask finish is an abundance of fruit sugar sweetness; cherry raspberry plus freshly picked mint leaves. This is a bold muscular assertive grain where the juicy fruit is soured by aniseed licorice and toasted walnut. Notes of dried apple accompany a hot drying finish. Water straightens it all out though. Â£50
Clan Denny (distilled at Girvan) 1992 21 year old HH9451 59.6%,Single Grain Whisky,79,108,A sweet aromatic nose with fresh cream flaked almonds macaroons pomegranate juice and a veneer of vanilla from this refill barrel. The palate starts warm and sweet then revs up to full power; light butterscotch cotton candy clementine Toledo marzipan and corn kernels with a hint of fresh green salad leaves. The short finish picks over corn cake mix and cream soda. Power but not enough finesse from the wood here.Â Â£64
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Strathclyde) 10 year old 2005 50.9%,Single Grain Whisky,78,57,One might speculate about the initial qualities of this young grain prior to its sherry cask finish. While it boasts a richer color the nose is reminiscent of roast beef plasticine wet dog and bruised raspberries. In the mouth it has good weight though mouth puckering with some brief rubbery notes early on before showing strawberry bubblegum sugar crystals black cherry rhubarb faint coffee notes and an ever-growing pepperiness. An enjoyable finish of baked apple and star anise. (727 bottles) Â£44
Girvan No. 4 Apps 42%,Single Grain Whisky,78,76,The entry level official Girvan is named after their â€˜MPS' distillation apparatus that distills at various pressures and under vacuum to vaporize and distill at lower temperatures. This is very light with fresh whole pineapples orange fondant creams delicate vanilla and risen dough. It's fiendishly sweet (have a dental hygienist on standby) like a deep layer of butter frosting sticky cotton candy honey overripe bananas and spearmint. The expeditious finish tenders cookie mix digestive biscuits and a grind of pepper.Â Â£45
H5 Iced Single Grain 40%,Single Grain Whisky,77,22,Boldly this is naturally colored (barely colored) 3 year old grain whisky presented in a tall clear bottle. The predominant aroma of corn husks is mixed with a sentimental schoolroom whiff of white glue peeled from the fingertips. There's wheat cracker bread cooked ham dripping foliage and chopped parsley. A clean refreshing mouthfeel with pleasant marshmallow sweetness is nixed by flavors of corn sliced bread and vanilla but they are hastily extinguished. A finishing spicy glimmer shuts down quickly too.
Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Port Dundas) 25 year old 1990 51.5%,Single Grain Whisky,77,129,Squished rosehip nuttiness and seasoned wood but there is little else of note on this one. The palate has corn sweetness red fruits pomegranate cherry lips and descends into soor ploom territory with more oak wood. The finish continues the woody theme with a residual baked apple note.Â  Port Dundas can be wonderful to drink but with no shortage of good to great grain whisky on the market I feel this one is past its best. (258 bottles) Â£90
Black Bowmore 1964 vintage 42 year old 40.5%,Single Malt Scotch,97,4500,What impresses me most is how this whisky evolves; it's incredibly complex. On the nose and palate this is a thick viscous whisky with notes of sticky toffee earthy oak fig cake roasted nuts fallen fruit pancake batter black cherry ripe peach dark chocolate-covered espresso bean polished leather tobacco a hint of wild game and lingering leafy damp kiln smoke. Flavors continue on the palate long after swallowing. This is what we all hope for (and dream of) in an older whisky!
Bowmore 46 year old (distilled 1964) 42.9%,Single Malt Scotch,97,13500,There have been some legendary Bowmores from the mid-60s and this is every bit their equal. All of them share a remarkable aroma of tropical fruit which here moves into hallucinatory intensity: guava mango peach pineapple grapefruit. There's a very light touch of peat smoke more a memory of Islay than the reality. Concentrated; even at low strength the palate is silky heady and haunting and lasts forever in the dry glass. A legend is born. (Eight bottles only for the U.S.) Editor's Choice.
Ardbeg Corryvreckan 57.1%,Single Malt Scotch,96,85,Powerful muscular well-textured and invigorating. Even within the realm of Ardbeg this one stands out. The more aggressive notes of coal tar damp kiln anise and smoked seaweed are supported by an array of fruit (black raspberry black cherry plum) dark chocolate espresso molasses bacon fat kalamata olive and warming cinnamon on the finish. Quite stunning!
Gold Bowmore 1964 vintage 42.4% ,Single Malt Scotch,96,6250,Deep gold color. Surprisingly lively on the nose for its age. A complex array of fruit (tangerine sultana pink grapefruit papaya and the general overall citrus DNA that you'll find in old Bowmores) with balancing notes of honey and vanilla. A hint of damp smoke and coconut. Just like with Black Bowmore this is a texturally soothing whisky on the palate which continues to evolve in waves -- first the sweet honey coating vanilla and lively fruit then turning quite visceral with juicy oak damp earth deep peat smoke and charcoal followed by another wave of fruit (this time dried fruit) finishing off with subtle charred oak and roasted nuts. This whisky is better than White Bowmore and it falls just short of Black Bowmore (which I rated 97) because it's just a bit softer and less vibrant on the palate.
Bowmore 40 year old 44.8%,Single Malt Scotch,96,11000,Definitely showing its age but not in a bad way â€” the distillery character is still there. Solid foundation of thick chewy toffee old pot still rum and fig cake. Fruity too with notes of golden raisin and nectarine. Soft seductive peat smoke juicy oak cinnamon and brine round out the palate. Excellent balance! One of the finest Bowmore whiskies I've ever tasted (and at this price will probably never taste again.) (Editor's Pick) 
The Dalmore 50 year old 52.8%,Single Malt Scotch,96,1500,The Dalmore is one of a handful of whiskies that seem to be able to age in the cask for many decades and still improve. This one is incredibly viscous on the nose and palate (and very heavy on the tongue) with chewy toffee and old pot still rum. The classic Dalmore marmalade note shines throughout along with vanilla cream an array of dried spices (especially cinnamon and evergreen) juicy oak forest bedding rancio old armagnac polished leather tobacco maple syrup dark chocolate almond macaroon and subtle espresso. Long mouth-coating finish. The flavors evolve like waves lapping on the palate -- especially the interplay with the oak. I can't drink this whisky slowly enough. A rare experience for the lucky few who can afford it. (Price is per 100ml).
Glenfarclas Family Casks 1954 Cask #1260 47.2%,Single Malt Scotch,96,3360,A rich amber color and elegantly oxidized notes greet you. There are luscious old fruitsâ€”pineapple dried peach apricotâ€”and puffs of coal-like smokiness. In time sweet spices (cumin especially) emerge. Superbly balanced. The palate while fragile still has real sweetness alongside a lick of treacle. It can take a drop of water allowing richer darker fruits to emerge. The finish is powerful long and resonant. Superb not over-wooded and a fair price for such a rarity.Â Â£1995
The Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1969 vintage 50.8%,Single Malt Scotch,96,750,It's great that Glenlivet releases whiskies under the 'Cellar Collection' label. It really shows the true potential of Glenlivet. This bottling is classic ultra-matured Glenlivet and rivals the 1959 vintage Cellar Collection as the best one ever. An incredibly complex whisky with notes of vanilla ripe barley coconut and caramel. All this is accentuated by glazed orange hazelnut and a potpourri of dried spices. Not the least bit tired for such an aged whisky. (Only 800 bottles for the U.S.)
Macallan 1976 Vintage 29 year old cask #11354 45.4%,Single Malt Scotch,96,1500,Classic sherry cask-aged Macallan. Antique amber with hints of ruby. Thickly textured complex and quite deep with notes of toffee ripe pit fruit raisin apple pie dried spice (cinnamon clove ginger and mint) and a wisp of smoke. An exceptional multi-faceted Macallan! 
Ardbeg 1974 Vintage Cask #3145 49.9%,Single Malt Scotch,95,20000,Cask #3145 is the lighter in color and the sweet notes that balance the smoke and seaweed are not as deeply caramelized as Cask #3542. I'm tasting hints of shortbread and caramel which show through the peat smoke tobacco toasted nuts firm spice notes (cinnamon clove and mint) and lingering brine. Very complex. Price listed includes the entire Double Barrel 1974 Vintage set.
Ardbeg Uigeadail 54.2%,Single Malt Scotch,95,70,With the Ardbeg 17 year old off the market it's nice to see a new Ardbeg in the line-up. Uigeadail costs about the same as the Ardbeg 17 did but with Uigeadail you're getting a much more interesting whisky. Uigeadail consists of a marriage of younger whisky (from 1990 and 1993) with much older whisky matured in sherry casks. The marriage works exceptionally well with the younger whiskies providing the classic Ardbeg intensity many of us have come to expect while the older whiskies contribute depth maturity and complexity. And bottling the whisky at cask-strength without chill-filtration ensures that none of the flavors are stripped out. This is an incredibly complex Islay whisky with its bonfire smoke brine and peppered olive notes balanced by a taming sweetness of vanilla marshmallow and toffee. Interwoven notes of candied fruit and sugared almonds round out the palate. Incredibly long finish. 
Balvenie 1973 43 year old 46.6%,Single Malt Scotch,95,15000,This expression was matured in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. Overtly sherried with figs sultanas cinnamon and old warm leather on the nose. Finally fragrant with milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. The Turkish delight carries over to the palate before the chocolate darkens to plain with raisins smoked ham and cloves in the long finish. Remarkably almost no tannic oak. Textbook stuff.
Bowmore 50 year old (distilled 1961) 40.7%,Single Malt Scotch,95,26650,The whisky is sensational a glorious mix of ginseng syrup baked banana semi-dried tropical fruits and an exotic smoked edge. Without the last you could believe it was a delicate Cognac. In time there's peppermint and guava syrup. A sip is all you need to reveal perfect thrilling harmony: light nuttiness pollen subtle fruits gentle smoke and light fungal touches. It's stunning but it's Â£16000! Whisky this great even in limited quantities should be fairly priced. Points off. Â£16000
Brora 30 year old 55.7%,Single Malt Scotch,95,400,Astonishingly fresh and clean for 30 years in oak and with incredible depth. Slight oily texture. Appetizing brine with honeyed vanilla mustard seed green olive Seville orange and lemon zest. Underlying smoke damp peat and seaweed. Put simply Brora at its finest. 
Lombard 'Jewels of Scotland' (distilled at Brora) 1982 vintage 50%,Single Malt Scotch,95,200,Bottled in 2004 but just recently put in circulation here in the U.S. (Very strange.) It's worth the wait. It's fresh (even at 22 years old) appetizing spicy and briny. There's a sweet foundation of vanilla wafer and caramel with a slightly oily texture. White pepper seaweed mustard seed lime gherkin and teasing gin botanicals add complexity. Spicy salty finish. A vibrant dynamic expression of the shuttered original Clynelish distillery. Quite stunning actually. Find yourself a bottle before they're gone!
Brora 30 year old (2009 Release) 53.2%,Single Malt Scotch,95,400,This whisky has all the positive aspects of a very mature whisky (depth complexity) without all the negative ones (excessive oak one-dimensional). Very clean but oily in texture with honeyed vanilla caramel citrus (tangerine orange lemon) nectarine olive brine black pepper ginger cut grass mustard seed and just the hint of teasing smoke. Briny spicy finish. Wonderful!
Brora 2010 54.3%,Single Malt Scotch,95,455,Though Brora has acquired cult status it has to be said that for a few years these Special Release Broras went through an off-putting butyric phase which might well have put off newbies to this legendary closed site who must have wondered what all the fuss was about.One nose of the 2010 SR shows that these days have been consigned to the past. This is classy from the word go. Gold in color; the nose manages to be both overtly waxy â€” I'm reminded of waxed paper â€” and fragrant. Behind that is coal smoke rather than the heavy peatiness of earlier vintages (Brora's peating levels varied in its last years). In other words this is robust and powerful with an evocative aroma that speaks of old sea chests the seashore and vellum. Hugely concentrated with massed fruits â€” quince especially â€” following behind. This is amplified with a drop or two of water. The palate is unctuous and heavy. Tectonic plates move more quickly than this does in the mouth. When it does the oily/waxy textures and flavors move slowly â€” camphor peach membrillo hints of citrus and toward the finish a growing brininess (akin to olives) and a hint of smoke. Elemental and one of the best Broras for years. [not available in the U.S.]Â£280  
Brora 35 year old 49.9%,Single Malt Scotch,95,750,Maturation of this 1978 distillate has taken place in European oak and refill American oak casks. Fresh and fruity on the early herbal nose; a hint of wax plus brine developing walnut fudge and an underlying wisp of smoke. Finally wood resin. The palate is very fruity with mixed spices then plain chocolate damp undergrowth gentle peat smoke and finally coal. Mildly medicinal. Ashy peat and aniseed linger in the long slowly drying finish. Brora at its very best. (2944 bottles) Editor's Choice
Glenfarclas 1968 Vintage 43% ABV,Single Malt Scotch,95,200,It has been quite a while since we've seen a new Glenfarclas here in the U.S. but after tasting this whisky it was worth the wait. Glenfarclas is a rich stylish whisky that ages very well and this 1968 vintage proves it. It is very deep and mature with complex fruit (sultana marmalade) layered by sweetness (honey caramel and toffee). All those years in oak contribute another dimension to the whisky providing a dry oaky spiciness polished leather and a hint of tobacco-especially on the finish. Never does the whisky taste tired or excessively woody. It expresses all that is good about an older whisky without any of the down side. I'm told that most of the 1400 bottles imported to the U.S. went to the Chicago area. It's worth taking the extra time to track down a bottle. 
Glenfarclas 40 year old 46%,Single Malt Scotch,95,460,Glenfarclas has a proven track record for aging very well. I've enjoyed some amazing 25 and 30 year old expressions in addition to some older vintage offerings. Does this new 40 year old follow suit? Absolutely! It's complex and well-rounded with great depth and no excessive oak. Lush candied citrus (especially orange) old pot still rum maple syrup fig roasted nuts and polished leather with hints of mocha candied ginger and tobacco. A bit oily in texture (which I find soothing) with good tannic grip on the finish. A classic well-matured Glenfarclas â€” and a very good value for its age. (Editor's Choice)
Glenglassaugh 40 year old 44.6%,Single Malt Scotch,95,2525,An excellent example of an ultra-mature sherried whisky done the right way. Much darker and more decadent than the other two releases here. Silky texture. Rummy jammy fruit toasted walnut leather spice (cinnamon clove) tobacco and dark chocolate with a foundation of juicy oak. Tasting this whisky you know it's old but you also know it's very good. 
The Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1973 vintage 49%,Single Malt Scotch,95,1250,A marriage of three casks one of them an ex-sherry butt. The sherry is certainly evident and this is more sherried than many of the Cellar Collection whiskies to date. Opulent and seductive with prominent fruit (glazed spiced oranges ripe peach and hints of pineapple and coconut) caramel-coated nuts and vanilla custard. A peppering of ginger and cinnamon throughout. Coating soothing finish. Polished and seamless with no trace of excessive oak. One of the richest -- and finest -- Cellar Collections to date. Anyone willing and able to cough up the bucks for this whisky will be richly rewarded. (Only 240 bottles available in the U.S. beginning June 2010.)
Highland Park Cask #13308 1973 vintage 33 year old 54.4%,Single Malt Scotch,95,280,Dark and decadent. Notes of old pot still rum roasted nuts chocolate fudge burnished leather Dundee cake tobacco and a hint of damp peat. When I drink this I feel like I'm sitting in the study of a stately Scottish mansion contemplating a fine aged Cuban cigar. Royalty in a glass. (Bottled for Binny's Beverage Depot) 
Laphroaig 25 year old (2008 Edition) 51.2%,Single Malt Scotch,95,500,The flavors evolve on the nose and palate with peat kiln smoke fresh asphalt damp earth warehouses morning-after campfire ash and old boat dock contrasting nicely with toffee apple crÃ¨me caramel delicate raspberry preserve and dried citrus. Long smoky spicy briny seaweed dirty martini-tinged finish. This whisky comes from a combination of both sherry and bourbon casks and the marriage works. I also like that it retains some of its youthful brashness while showing the depth that maturity affords a whisky. A delicious well-balanced old-fashioned Laphroaig.(Reviewing this whisky gave me an excuse to open a â€œfreshâ€ bottle of its predecessor the 30 year old and here are my thoughts. The 30 year old is softer mellower drier and more debonair. The 25 year old is bolder more youthful more dynamic richer and sweeter -- bottling at cask strength really helps here. Both whiskies are very nice but quite different in personality.)
The Macallan Estate Reserve 45.7%,Single Malt Scotch,95,215,Amber color. Richly textured (great mouth feel) with vanilla fudge nougat ripe citrus and ginger cake leading to a complex spicy finish. Great depth on this one. Well-polished. My pick of the lot.
Dun Bheagan (distilled at Springbank) Cask No. 1704 35 year old 1970 vintage 50.5%,Single Malt Scotch,95,300,Quite fresh and appetizing for a 35 year old whisky but not too surprising for a Springbank. Notes of creamy vanilla burnt caramel coconut custard brine and a hint of anise. Complex vibrant and well-balanced. Reminds me why I love those old Springers. Devotees will not be disappointed. A stunning whisky! (Exclusive to Astor Wines and Spirits.) 
Jewels of Scotland (distilled at Springbank) 1965 vintage 46%,Single Malt Scotch,95,400,Bottled in 2001 but still in circulation and (fortunately) just finding its way to me. These Springers from the â€˜60s are getting rarer and quite expensive. This is a great example of why they are so coveted -- clean and well matured with no sign of excessive oak. Elegant sherried fruit dovetails nicely with polished oak and a steady stream of dried spices. Look for citrus nectarine red licorice coconut oil ripe banana and vanilla custard with warming cinnamon and brine. Warm spicy finish. Very polished!
Aberfeldy 14 year old Single Cask 58.1%,Single Malt Scotch,94,181,Single cask Aberfeldy bottlings are very few and far between and this is a stunner! After hogshead maturation the whisky ultimately underwent a period of finishing in an ex-sherry cask prior to bottling. The nose offers sultanas raisins and hot chocolate. Developing vanilla and a hint of over-ripe bananas. Finally burnt sugar and caramel. Insinuating and syrupy on the palate with apricots dried fruits honey and sherry. Gently spicy and warming with licorice in the notably long finish. Â£115
Ardbeg 1974 Vintage Cask #3524 49.9%,Single Malt Scotch,94,20000,Cask #3524 is darker with notes of sticky toffee pudding and chewy caramel that firmly support the polished leather cigar box roasted chestnut smoked seaweed tar dark chocolate and on the finish espresso. A meditative whisky. Price listed includes entire Double Barrel 1974 Vintage set.
The Balvenie Vintage Cask 1976 vintage 53%,Single Malt Scotch,94,800,Very spicy and complex with incredible depth. Once again this 30-plus year old whisky proves the aging ability of Balvenie. Still quite vibrant and invigorating for such maturity. The classic Balvenie honey note is there but more reserved along with graham cracker vanilla wafer citrus peel raspberry (red and black) nectarine and polished oak. Long spicy finish. Another outstanding Balvenie Vintage Cask. Although I look at the price and remember how shocked I was when the Balvenie vintages were selling for $400.
Balvenie Tun 1401 Batch No. 3 50.3%,Single Malt Scotch,94,250,A combination of three sherry butts and seven bourbon casks. This is a complex dynamic whisky loaded with lush layered ripe fruit (red berries tropical fruit honeyed apricot raisin) toffee oak resin polished leather and well-defined spice notes (cinnamon vanilla nutmeg clove). Long warming finish. (Exclusive to the U.S.) 
Signatory (distilled at Bowmore) 35 year old 1970 vintage 51.9%,Single Malt Scotch,94,500,Lush thick fruit and chewy toffee soothes the assertive notes of earthy peat and leafy bonfire. Underlying smoked nuts brine kalamata olives and tobacco provide continued entertainment. A complex whisky that completely envelops the palate. This is an excellent example of a mature sherried Bowmore. 
White Bowmore 1964 vintage 43 year old 42.8%,Single Malt Scotch,94,6000,I like this Bowmore better than all the previous bourbon oak-aged ultra-mature Bowmore whiskies that have been released over the past fifteen years (there have been several). The oak is always present but not dominant. The whisky really evolves on the palate just like the Black Bowmore releases. This emphasis here is on fruit bright fruit: peach tangerine mango ripe melon and pineapple. There's a soft gentle side to the whisky too enhanced by sweeter notes of pancake syrup orange creamsicle and white chocolate. Heavy oak notes emerge along with teasing earthy smoke to give the whisky depth and bottom notes. The smoke and oak linger long on the finish. Very contemplative. In short an outstanding whisky but not quite reaching the excellence of Black Bowmore. (Allocation information: 732 bottles available worldwide; 40 bottles are being allocated for the U.S. half of the quantity of Black Bowmore which was released earlier this year.)
Bowmore 1966 50 year old 41.5%,Single Malt Scotch,94,30000,The third and most exclusive release in Bowmore's Vault Legends Collection was matured for 50 years in bourbon hogshead #5675. The nose is fragrant and musky slightly oily with orange peel developing vanilla and green citrus notes. Intense orange and peach on the palate with black pepper aniseed and sweet oak. Very persistent tangy citrus fruits through the extremely long finish. No negative tannic notes. (74 bottles)
Brora 35 year old Special Release 2012 48.1%,Single Malt Scotch,94,645,Previous Broras in the Diageo Special Release series have set the bar remarkably high and this the eleventh such bottling does not disappoint. The component whiskies were distilled during 1976 and 1977 and matured in refill American oak casks. The nose offers lemon and contrasting vanilla and honeycomb aromas. Musty malt and coal in the background. The citrus and honey themes continue into the slightly earthy peppery palate while French mustard and coal figure in the drying finish. 1566 bottles.
Brora 40 year old Single Cask 1972 Vintage 59.1%,Single Malt Scotch,94,11824,Just 160 bottles of 1972 Brora are available through UK World of Whiskies and World Duty Free Group stores. The oldest bottling of Brora to date was distilled using heavily-peated malt. A big hit of oily peat on the early nose with malt dried fruit and black pepper. Mildly medicinal. The palate yields bonfire ash licorice honey more pepper and well-integrated oak. The finish is long with peat smoke plain chocolate and tannins lingering in harmony. Complex and rewarding.Â Â£7000
Brora 1978 35 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014) 48.6%,Single Malt Scotch,94,1250,This is the 13th annual release of Brora which has been aged in refill American oak and refill European oak casks. Hessian and hemp on the early nose with a whiff of ozone discreet peat and old tar. Fragrant and fruity notes develop with ripe apples and a hint of honey. The palate is waxy sweet and spicy with heather and ginger. Mildly medicinal and smoky. Dries steadily in the finish to aniseed black pepper dark chocolate and fruity tannins. (2964 bottles)
Bruichladdich Legacy 6 34 year old 41%,Single Malt Scotch,94,550,The sixth and last bottling from the Legacy series. Legacy 6 is a marriage of six casks from 1965 1970 and 1972. Soft and mellow on the nose and palate with unbelievably restrained oak for such a mature whisky. Delicious notes of coconut soothing vanilla caramel custard and banana cream peppered with spice notes of cinnamon mint and teaberry that emerge on a soft finish that fades out gently. A fitting end to the Legacy series. I'm sad to see them go. 
Bunnahabhain 35 year old 1971 vintage 44.9%,Single Malt Scotch,94,700,Bottled to celebrate the 125th Anniversary of the distillery. Classic Bunnahabhain-toffeed and quite nutty. Almost rummy in nature with rich molasses notes throughout and layers of sweetness. Some salt emerges on occasion as do notes of honey coconut and candied fruit with a pleasingly dry gently spicy finish to round everything out. Surprisingly youthful for its age nicely balanced and very drinkable. A great Bunnahabhain! 
The Dalmore Stillman's Dram 28 Year Old 45%,Single Malt Scotch,94,140,For the past several years the Stillman's Dram expression of The Dalmore has been a 30 year old. This new 28 year old expression besides being two years younger is also slightly less sherried. In this instance I feel that both have enhanced the whisky. Trimming back on the sherry and oak allows the whisky's trademark orange marmalade complex spice and briny freshness to shine through. This one is lively dynamic evolving well-balanced and always entertaining. The best Dalmore Stillman's Dram in years. 
Glendronach 33 year old 40%,Single Malt Scotch,94,400,Matured entirely in oloroso sherry butts this whisky is chock-full of lush fruit roasted nuts deep spice notes and a hint of damp smoke. It is wonderfully integrated with incredible depth and maturity without being tired-and it expresses a soothing quality that doesn't quit. It is stunning throughout and more polished and rounded than the 1968 Vintage released a while back which while enjoyable was a tad sappy and a bit too oaky at times. This whisky is easily one of the 10 best new whiskies for 2005 and worth every penny. Get a bottle while you can. 
GlenDronach Grandeur 31 year old 45.8%,Single Malt Scotch,94,700,The new ultra-mature release following its 33 year old predecessor (bottled by previous owners). It's nice to see the higher ABV given that the 33 year old was only 40%. Very soothing. Quite deep on the nose and viscous (almost sappy) on the palate with gobs of juicy oak and old oak (its age is obvious but not imposing) dark raisin black raspberry orange marmalade roasted nuts and freshly roasted coffee beans. All of this is peppered with cinnamon ginger and charcoal. Polished leather on the finish. I like that it's sherried and the sherry is kept in balance. Those of you who liked the 33 year old will also enjoy this one (assuming you can afford it).
Glenfarclas Family Casks 1987 Cask #3829 48%,Single Malt Scotch,94,387,This is the bomb. Savory and lightly meaty but sweetened by plum sauce; there's even some strawberry around the fringes. You could see how with another 30 years this would end up like the '54. Elegant yet powerful there's sandalwood incense marmalade even a little dried mango. The distillery's density is balanced by this fruit. Lush with supple tannins and at its best neat. From a refill butt this is an exemplary sherried malt.Â Â£230
Glengoyne 40 year old 45.9%,Single Malt Scotch,94,5730,Aged in sherry butts which is a departure from some of the older Glengoyne vintage samples I have which show more bourbon barrel characteristics. It is a very fruity spicy textural dram with spiced apple red raspberry strawberry plum golden raisin fried plantain and creme brulee. Good grip on the finish with grape stems and warming spice (cinnamon cracked peppercorn and clove). I love the balance on this whisky. It has aged very gracefully. (Limited to 250 bottles worldwide.)
Glenmorangie Astar 2017 52.5%,Single Malt Scotch,94,100,The first bottling of Astar was released in 2008. The 2017 release was matured in casks made of oak from Missouri's Ozark Mountains. The nose is floral with rosehips orange blossom and milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. Honey and citrus notes follow. Voluptuous on the palate; sweet even sugary fresh fruit notes plus vanilla cinnamon and cloves. Drying from coconut to plain chocolate in the lengthy finish. Extremely accomplished. (Individual reviewer rating: 93)
Highland Park 34 year old 1971 vintage (Cask #8363) 53%,Single Malt Scotch,94,325,Rummy molasses and toffee sweetness intertwine with roasted nuts and bright juicy fruit. Suggestions of fig lavender leather and tobacco throughout with a hint of peat and polished oak on the finish. Not quite as refined as the Highland Park 18 year old but it makes up for this with its dynamic personality. A delicious ultra-mature sherry cask-aged whisky. (A Binny's Beverage Depot exclusive.) 
Highland Park Cask #7957 1977 vintage 29 year old 48.5%,Single Malt Scotch,94,300,A delicious well-balanced ultra-matured expression of Highland Park. Toffee apples molasses and vanilla fudge provide a sweet foundation with evolving notes of dark chocolate dry spicy oak tobacco subtle smoke and lingering brine on the finish. Nicely done. (Bottled for Old Oaks Cigar & Wine Company) 
Highland Park 32 year old 1973 Vintage Cask #8375 41.3%,Single Malt Scotch,94,350,An essay in elegance. Silky and soft in texture and very clean. Notes of peaches and cream vanilla wafer soft honey and fruit gum drops. Subtler notes of tropical fruit (pineapple lemon coconut) demerara sugar heather and anise. Polished oak adds structure and contrast with a very elegant finish. Hard to believe this whisky is 32 years old. It's lighter and more elegant than the equally splendid Highland Park 30 year old which I rated a 94 in the last issue. (Bottled exclusively for Park Avenue Liquors.)
Highland Park 30 Year Old 48.1%,Single Malt Scotch,94,350,An exemplary Highland Park. There's certainly plenty of sherry influence in this whisky and it is complementary. (About 2/3 of the whisky was aged on sherry casks and a lot of these casks were second fill.) The whisky enjoys a delicious foundation of toffee fruit (lemon plum blueberries) and dark chocolate. It continues to develop and evolve on the palate with emerging notes of heather nougat lavender delicate peat and complex dried spice (especially cinnamon and nutmeg) to balance the sweeter notes. The extra alcohol is also a bonus providing a drying balance to the whisky's sweetness. Whiskies like this one remind me why I fell in love with whisky in the first place.
Highland Park 1964 vintage 42.2%,Single Malt Scotch,94,6088,A marriage of two casks (refill hogsheads). Significantly darker in color than the 1968 vintage. Darker (and more serious) in personality too. Red berries (strawberry raspberry) rhubarb plum oak sap vanilla bean smoldering peat coffee grounds toasted almond and dusty malt. The finish is long and contemplative with notes of polished leather juicy oak and telicherry peppercorns. Â£3750
Highland Park 1970 vintage 48%,Single Malt Scotch,94,3500,This limited edition bottling consists of a marriage of both European and American oak. Still lively for its age and beautifully balanced. Bountiful golden fruit (sultana pineapple upside down cake tangerine overripe nectarine) balanced by soothing creamy vanilla. A peppering of dried spice chamomile tea toasted oak cigar box and subtle smoke round out the palate. Soft and seductive. (Not available in the U.S.)Â£2250
Highland Park 18 Year Old 43%,Single Malt Scotch,94,112,Introduced to the Highland Park portfolio in 1997. Gentle peat soft toffee floral notes and honey on the beautifully fragrant nose.  Superbly balanced on the velvety palate with brittle toffee stewed fruits peat honey and a hint of coffee. Smoke and more toffee mingle in the long elegant finish. 
Lagavulin 12 year old 56.5%,Single Malt Scotch,94,109,There's precious little reticence about this beast which leaps out of the glass blowing peat smoke everywhere  then comes raffia Lapsang Souchong tea seashore wet rocks Elastoplast talcum powder bog myrtle (laurel) vetiver and the aromas of a just-expunged peat bonfire with apples baking on it. Huge and complex in other words.The palate starts with a fug of smoke being belched at you (non-peat freaks look away now) then distinct saltiness enlivens the tongue before everything plunges down; intense sweetness takes charge for a moment before it shifts into charred creosoted timbers. This begs for some water and when it's added out comes sandalwood and peat smoke and tar and an orris root-like character â€” it's not often I get gin-like notes on Lagavulin but it's here  which rolls over you as you roll over and succumb to its power. After this year's sublime distillery-only bottling it's clear that Lagavulin is in a real purple patch. Superb. 
 Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017) 56.5%,Single Malt Scotch,94,130,This is the 15th Special Releases bottling of Lagavulin 12 year old. Matured in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is smoky with kippers charcuterie and bonfire embers offset by berry fruits. On the unctuous palate smoke blends with vanilla green apples and licorice plus pepper and sea salt. Peppery ashy peat in the lengthy finish. (Individual reviewer rating: 91)
Laphroaig Triple Wood 48%,Single Malt Scotch,94,100,This is the first time I've been up for reviews here so I had a game plan: play it cool mark tightly let everyone know I'm hard to please. Then they gave me this the whisky equivalent to front row tickets to Neil Young on his current Twisted Road tour: not just a chance to get up close and personal with an old favorite but to do so with an old favorite who's on fire. Laphroaig's owners are intent on ensuring a big peaty engine for any new release but this is a monster by anyone's standards. It's essentially Quarter Cask finished in oloroso sherry casks so in addition to the intense charcoal smoke attack there are rich fruity notes; blackcurrant and berries. It's an evening barbecue whisky. Grill that fish until it's blackened and crispy drizzle on lemon and as the smoke rears up in protest sip this. Big moody broody fruity and rich: what's not to love? (Travel Retail and some European specialist retailers.) â€“ (Dominic Roskrow)
The Macallan Fine Oak 17 year old 43%,Single Malt Scotch,94,120,Another of the Fine Oak series (aged in both bourbon and sherry casks) which will debut in the U.S. in March. Of the five Fine Oak expressions that will be in the U.S. (10 15 17 21 and 30 year old) this is my favorite slightly besting the 15 year old. Lovely sweet notes (creamy vanilla light toffee marshmallow shortbread and a kiss of honey) are accompanied by bright fruit (multi-layered citrus) and potpourri of dried spices along with a hint of nut and wisp of smoke. A very refined and sophisticated whisky. 
The Macallan 1824 Limited Release 48%,Single Malt Scotch,94,1900,Antique amber. The darkest and most decadent of the four. Quite viscous and soothing with well-layered notes of apple pie marmalade and maple syrup balanced by dried fruits ginger polished leather tobacco and resinous oak. One to sip and savor very slowly. (This whisky is much better than the last ultra-premium release the Macallan 55 year old in the Lalique Decanter and thousands of dollars less.)
Scotch Malt Whisky Society Hunting Hound on Holiday 4.180 24 year old 1989 51.3%,Single Malt Scotch,94,225,From the nose you can tell this is a special whisky with old dark lacquered wood dusty cigar box and sea salt combined with dark sweet cherry and a hint of rancio. On the palate it gets even better with lush dark cherry perfectly balanced and integrated with oak spice salt and peat smoke. There's clear rancio in the center of it all that's utterly delicious. This stunner finishes with a long slightly spicy and entirely lovely finish. (Park Avenue Liquor only)
Ardbeg 10 year old 46%,Single Malt Scotch,93,55,Straw-gold color. On the nose sweet toffee citrus notes seaweed and spice complement a powerful peat smoke infusion. In body it is thick and oily. On the palate a somewhat sweet maltiness up front is run over by a powerful peat smoke locomotive. Again the whisky is enriched with citrus and pear notes spice and seaweed. The finish is powerful long and warming. The smoke lingers for minutes if not hours. If you like your Ardbeg to go to a phenolic extreme you will cherish this one. This big powerful whisky makes no apologies for its Islay roots. And the fact that this whisky is bottled at 46% ABV just makes this big whisky even bigger.
Ardbeg An Oa,Single Malt Scotch,93,60,Ardbeg's first standard release in nearly a decade An Oa is matured in virgin oak Pedro XimÃ©nez and bourbon barrels with component whiskies married in the distillery's French oak 'Gathering Vat.' The nose offers sweet peat smoky lemon rind ginger and angelica. A soft and sweet palate entry is followed by hot peat black tea peppery cloves and aniseed. Black pepper lingers through the long smoky finish.
Balvenie Cask #17893 1974 vintage 52.8%,Single Malt Scotch,93,600,The newest offering from the impressive Balvenie vintage cask line. Honey caramel custard and Seville orange notes with evolving -- and increasingly noticeable -- dried spice oak resin and leather that integrates well with the sweet fruity notes. Incredible depth and complexity. The Balvenie vintage reputation remains intact.
Balvenie 1973 Vintage 30 year old Cask #9219,Single Malt Scotch,93,400,The last Balvenie Vintage whisky I tasted that was this old was the exceptional 1966 Vintage. This new vintage has some big shoes (or should I say bottles?) to fill so how does it stand up to the 1966 Vintage? This 1973 Vintage is equally as impressive. In contrast to the massive evolving sherry-influenced 30 year old reviewed below this one shows more subtlety and finesse. It is also a very clean and polished affair-signs of an obviously excellent cask. A honeyed malty foundation incorporates notes of dried fruit (orange lemon) complex spice (vanilla cinnamon sandalwood) and subtle herbs. Very contemplative. 
Balvenie 25 year old 46.9%,Single Malt Scotch,93,250,Deep amber color. Exotic aromas of honey vanilla and tropical fruit (coconut pineapple mango). Medium to full in body and rich in texture. The palate delivers what the aroma promises-honey vanilla and more tropical fruit with a somewhat dry and rather lengthy finish. The Balvenie distillery enjoys an excellent reputation. The older expressions are particularly noteworthy. They age very gracefully. This one is a pure joy to drink. 
Balvenie 1961 55 year old 41.7%,Single Malt Scotch,93,60000,Aged in a European oak oloroso sherry hogshead. Orange marmalade and lanolin on the nose with caramel and candle wax dripped onto old leather. Full-bodied with slightly bitter orange notes plus nutmeg and aniseed on the palate. The orange theme persists into the finish as dried-out Jaffa segments plus edgy oak tannins. A highly individualistic Balvenie.
Bowmore 16 year old 1989 vintage 51.8%,Single Malt Scotch,93,90,No frills here just pure unadulterated Bowmore. This Islay whisky speaks of its location in a very pure and natural way. I find invigorating brine seaweed green olive and fishnets along with the classic Bowmore peat smoke. All these flavors are softened by gentle vanilla and honeyed malt while background tropical fruit add complexity. 
The Whisky Exchange Masterpieces Range (distilled at Bowmore) 1990 (18 year old) 61.6%,Single Malt Scotch,93,191,Bowmore lovers rarely get excited about the smokiness of their favorite single malt. Rather they obsess about the tropical fruits that some old bottlings exhibit. Here is one such example. Initially the nose suggests verjus and linseed oil but then peachiness rather than beachiness emerges. The smoke hits first on the tongue backed up with mango and violet then the tropical elements and the smoke play off each other up until a guava-laden finish. Â£120
Brora 37 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2015) 50.4%,Single Malt Scotch,93,1925,An old Special Releases favorite this is the fourteenth such Brora bottling. Distilled in 1977 and matured in refill American oak hogsheads it is the oldest Brora issued by Diageo to date. 2976 bottles have been released. Leather ginger and stewed fruits on the nose with smoky dusty aromas. Lighter and fresher than previous veteran releases with cooking apples cinnamon fudge dried grass and light peat on the palate. Sweet notes fade leaving earthy savory smoke in the long finish.
Brora 38 year old 48.6%,Single Malt Scotch,93,2200,Another Special Releases staple this is the fifteenth and oldest Brora in the series to date. The nose offers hemp oiled brown paper lemon juice ashy peat and sweetening malt. The oily palate boasts sweet fruit notes peaty toffee and ginger. Long in the softly smoky finish with black pepper plain chocolate char and licorice. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (2984 bottles)
Brora 34 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017) 51.9%,Single Malt Scotch,93,1700,Distilled in 1982 this expression was matured in refill American oak hogsheads. It is the 16th Brora in the Special Releases series. Ripe pears and vanilla on the nose; progressively more perfumed with developing toffee notes. Slightly waxy on the palate with fresh-squeezed lemon and sweet background smoke contrasting with spicy dark berries. Plain chocolate sultanas and raisins in the medium-length finish. A relatively restrained Brora. (3000 bottles)
Bruichladdich Legacy III 35 year old 1968 vintage 40.7%,Single Malt Scotch,93,430,This gem is soft and seductive in personality. It is also very clean and still quite fresh for its age-obviously aged in an excellent cask. You'll find a bed of gentle sweetness reminding me of coconut cream and vanilla mousse. A mÃ©lange of fruit (melon black raspberries strawberries) marries perfectly with the sweetness. Fresh brine notes and licorice root emerge on the palate and become more prominent towards the finish. This Legacy III is more polished and rounded and not as tired or woody when compared to the recent 40 year old bottling. And the 40 year old at $2200 a pop is also about five times more expensive.
Bruichladdich 1984 43.7%,Single Malt Scotch,93,1100,This 32 year old bottling was aged in twelve bourbon barrels and re-casked into fresh bourbon wood in 2009. It offers a nose of canned peaches dates marzipan and a hint of milky coffee. Rich fruit flavors lead on the palate: peach pineapple and mango with vanilla and nutty oak. Slowly drying in the finish with warming spices. Sometimes good bourbon casks are all you need. (3000 bottles)
Murray McDavid 'Mission' (distilled at Clynelish) 1986 46%,Single Malt Scotch,93,150,Deep gold color. Fresh exciting spicy aroma of brine exotic pepper seaweed and raw fruit with interwoven notes of delicate peat and caramel. Full-bodied and muscular. Flavors are incredibly vibrant and dynamic-almost challenging-and are similar to its aroma. Salty peppery intense finish. 
Cragganmore 29 year old 52.9%,Single Malt Scotch,93,300,Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Shimmering gold Aroma: Very complex with a potpourri of spicy herbal notes. There's a lot going on here. Nice depth too. Palate: Similar to its aroma nicely balanced and evolving. Lingering spicy finish. 
Cragganmore Triple Matured Edition 48%,Single Malt Scotch,93,135,Bottled for Friends of the Classic Malts (which means most of you) this is Cragganmore in early autumnal guise. Dry leaves underfoot ripe black fruits on the bushes waxed jacket chestnut and a whiff of cedary smoke opening into dried peach. The palate is thickly textured with those fruits dark chocolate and pomegranate molasses. The immensely long finish gives you light pepper smoke and blackberry jam. Cragganmore at its very best and at a great price.Â Â£80
Dalmore 1973 Vintage Gonzalez Byass Sherry Cask Finish 42% ABV,Single Malt Scotch,93,250,A thick lush whisky. Notes of honey-drenched citrus orange marmalade chewy toffee and almonds peppered with that classic coastal brine freshness and background spice I have come to love in Dalmore. Long contemplative finish. This whisky packs plenty of freshness and liveliness for 30 years on oak and is a pure joy to drink. 
The Dalmore 40 year old 40%,Single Malt Scotch,93,3000,By far the softest and gentlest of the range and oh so drinkable. Hard to believe that this whisky is 40 years old actually as it shows no sign of excessive oak. Instead there are soothing layers of caramel and toffee as the whisky's foundation. Add orange marmalade and other juicy citrus fruits cinnamon spice graham cracker and lightly toasted almond. A gentle subtly sophisticated Dalmore and an interesting comparison to the much different more visceral 50 year old. If I were a rich man I could drink this whisky every day -- it's so easy-going.
The Dalmore 1978 46%,Single Malt Scotch,93,750,This 1978 vintage release from The Dalmore has been â€˜finished' for two years in Matusalem sherry casks from Gonzalez Byass following 29 years in American white oak. Just 477 bottles are available. Freshly-ground coffee marzipan dark berries and rich sherry on the smooth nose with milk chocolate and Jaffa oranges. Smokier with water. Citrus fruits and more milk chocolate on the rich full palate plus roasted almonds. Long and juicy in the finish with aniseed and fruit pastilles. 
Dalmore 50 year old 40%,Single Malt Scotch,93,60000,This veteran Dalmore was matured successively in bourbon casks Matusalem oloroso sherry casks colheita port pipes more bourbon wood and finally Champagne casks. The nose offers orange marmalade vanilla milk chocolate maraschino cherries white pepper and a hint of black treacle. Sweet sherry and sultanas on the early palate with developing prunes and licorice. The finish is extremely long with increasing licorice plain chocolate wood spice and tannic oak. (50 bottles)
GlenDronach 15 year old 46%,Single Malt Scotch,93,95,Deeper richer more viscous and more intriguing than the 12 year old (and not as sappy as the 18 year old). Complex and intriguing with raisin orange marmalade grape skin sugar plum cinnamon bun raspberry preserve mixed nuts and coal ash. Nice tannic grip on the finish. The best of the bunch and very impressive!
GlenDronach 21 year old Parliament 48%,Single Malt Scotch,93,262,Part of the core range from GlenDronach Parliament has been aged in a mix of oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks and is non-chill filtered. Quite sweet sherry on the nose with fresh leather nutty peach notes cloves and pepper. Rich sherried fruits on the full palate with more pepper ginger and plain chocolate. The finish is long with licorice and oak tannins. Not to be rushed!
GlenDronach Grandeur 24 year old (Batch 9) 48.7%,Single Malt Scotch,93,750,A triumphant expression including whisky distilled in 1990 1992 and 1993 and matured in Spanish oak sherry butts. The nose offers creamy sweet sherry figs a hint of black treacle cinnamon and ripe cherries. The full palate yields sultanas tangy citrus fruit sweet oak roasted chestnuts and ginger. Lingering bright fruit notes in the finish with raisins plain chocolate and cigar boxes. (1487 bottles)
Glenfarclas Family Cask 1972 (Cask 3551) 44.7%,Single Malt Scotch,93,599,Dark amber in hue this shows immediate mature elegance with great sweetness â€” think of spiced honey or mead. There are some light notes of pecan pie and all the while that thread of the sod. Glenfarclas can never fully escape its dark roots. There's dried peach and fruit leather toffee and with water biscuits dunked in tea. The palate is autumnal and soft â€” fruit compote and peppermint. This is what you want from fully mature Glenfarclas at its peak. (A U.S. exclusive). 
Glenfarclas 1953 47.2%,Single Malt Scotch,93,9420,The hits just keep on coming for Glenfarclas. Here we see it not only with enormous age but in relaxed mode in terms of oak. You can tell it's old: the leathery waxiness and exotic fruits of whisky rancio; you can tell it's Glenfarclas because of the ever-present earthiness but both are intensified into a new aromatic realm: gentlemen's barbershop rowan berry and images of an old bonfire next to a gingerbread house. Mysterious subtle and highly complex. Â£5995
Glenfiddich 1973 Vintage Cask No. 9874 46.5%,Single Malt Scotch,93,600,An impressive single cask bottling of Glenfiddich. It really shows the natural potential of this distillery. Nothing fancy here just the pure elegance of Glenfiddich. Notes of shortbread demerara sugar and white chocolate spiced with toasted nuts cinnamon ginger and nutmeg. Very clean and polished. 
The Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1964 vintage 44.7%,Single Malt Scotch,93,2000,The fifth in a series of Glenlivet Cellar Collection whiskies. This is a very complex whisky with exotic notes of oak sultana vanilla cream almonds and evergreen. These notes are quite floral on the nose and well balanced with no hint of excessive aging. The palate is polished deep and continuously evolving with a long spicy finish. The oak notes reveal that this whisky has some years on it but they in no way dominate or detract from the other flavors. An outstanding effort! This rivals the 1959 vintages as the best of the Cellar Collection releases. You'll need deep pockets though. 
The Glenlivet Archive 21 year old 43%,Single Malt Scotch,93,100,Amber chestnut color. Aromas of mature oak leather ripe fruit and toffee are very deep and well balanced. Its flavors are rich and enveloping with notes of treacle toffee roasted nuts and a long spicy woody finish that lingers. 
The Glenlivet XXV 25 year old 43%,Single Malt Scotch,93,350,Finished in first-fill sherry casks for two years. My feeling on any whisky finished in a different cask is this: it should give as much to the flavor profile as it takes away. In this instance I feel it has and more. It's not as nimble as younger versions but the sherry along with the extra aging contributes a silky texture and a richer fuller dimension to the whisky. I can still detect some of the peach vanilla tropical fruit and honeyed malt I enjoy in younger expressions but its key flavor components are toffee honey-dipped citrus red licorice chocolate-covered almonds and fig along with dried spice (cinnamon nutmeg mint tea) that emerges on the palate and peaks on the finish. The flavors are seamless and elegantly balanced.
Glenmorangie Original 10 year old 43%,Single Malt Scotch,93,45,Fresh vibrant and beautifully complex. A clean malty foundation accentuated by bright complex fruit delicate spice dried flowers and gentle honeyed vanilla notes that linger on the palate. This is a wonderful whisky which is very versatile but I can only imagine what it would taste like at 46% and unchill-filtered like the wood finish expressions.
Glenmorangie Astar 57.1%,Single Malt Scotch,93,85,Astar's flavor profile is similar to Glenmorangie 10 year old in many respects showing a superb balance of sweetness fruit and spice. It's not as subtle as the 10 year old expression but it is creamier richer and fleshier with loads of honeyed vanilla coconut cream pie toasted almond vibrant spice (cinnamon mint) and a basketful of citrus and summer fruits. The fact that it is bottled at 100 British Proof (57.1% abv) just accentuates every flavor and helps to make this whisky quite invigorating. Imagine Glenmorangie 10 year old with a shot of testosterone. I don't rate very many ten year old (or younger ) whiskies over 90. This whisky has certainly earned it. 
Glenmorangie Pride 1981 56.7%,Single Malt Scotch,93,2850,Glenmorangie Pride employs the use of Sauternes barriques to give a 10 year period of secondary maturation to a batch of spirit distilled in 1981. The result is a whisky with an intense pungent earthy nose; very complex with polished old furniture notes spices oak tannins and licorice. The palate is â€˜full on' for a Glenmorangie; waxy with sherbet honey and baked apple then orange marmalade sultana and a hint of smoke in the lengthy finish. Available July 1 2011. Price is approximate.  
The Glenrothes 1975 vintage 43%,Single Malt Scotch,93,500,A polished very elegant expression with subtle complexity throughout. Notes of squeaky-clean fruit (tangerine peach nectarine kiwi) in light syrup. Vibrant spice (cinnamon white pepper anise) creamy vanilla and almond evolve on the palate leading to a gentle finish. Surprisingly lively for a whisky more than 30 years old. When I think of great Glenrothes vintages I go back to the 1972 vintage for comparison. Both are comparable in quality with the 1972 vintage showing darker sugars more weight and more roasted nuts. 
The Glenrothes â€œJohn Ramsayâ€ 46.7%,Single Malt Scotch,93,1000,Made from whisky aged in second fill American oak sherry casks distilled between 1973 to 1987. Richly malty with honeyed citrus juicy oak chocolate fudge and nougat. More subtle floral notes licorice (red and black) ginger and chamomile tea. Polished oak on the finish balances the sweetness. A great whisky to honor a great whisky maker! (Only 200 bottles for the U.S.)
Highland Park Cask #691 1983 vintage 23 year old 59.8%,Single Malt Scotch,93,150,Very sophisticated and subtly complex. Perhaps the lightest-colored of the bunch. Fresh appetizing brine and spice (cinnamon vanilla white pepper and clove) on a bed of soft honey and creamy vanilla with just a hint of fruit. The notes are bright clean and tight. Spicy briny finish. A beautifully delicate Highland Park. (Bottled for Green's) 
Highland Park 21 year old 47.5%,Single Malt Scotch,93,100,The good news: This is one of the best Highland Park whiskies I have ever tasted. The bad news: it's the new release for Travel Retail (formerly Duty Free). It's lush well-balanced and very complex. Well-defined notes of toffee candied fruit and roasted nuts are accentuated by background honey chocolate mousse and smoke. Here's the icing on the cake: it's bottled at 47.5% which really allows the flavors to shine. If you're going overseas consider tracking down a bottle. 
Highland Park 40 year old 48.3%,Single Malt Scotch,93,1900,Antique copper color with some streaks of gold. A complex array of dried fruit on the nose peppered with dried spice orange marmalade dark chocolate and wood shavings. On the palate the immediate impact is once again marmalade followed briefly by bramble before drier notes of dark chocolate wood shavings anise and subtle smoke emerge. Dry and spicy on the finish but never austere. A delicious contemplative 40 year old Highland Park that has aged gracefully. This is a permanent addition to the range. Out of curiosity I tasted it next to the other great Highland Parks (the 30 year old and several very good single cask bottlings over 30 years old). This whisky is in the same league as the others. Its only down side is that it's a lot more expensive than the others.
Highland Park 1968 vintage 45.6%,Single Malt Scotch,93,3657,A marriage of eight casks (seven hogsheads one sherry butt). A whisky in excellent shape for its age. Very clean and bright on the palate with no excessive oak. Notes of lemon tart clementine plum honeyed vanilla and polished oak peppered with clove soft mint marshmallow and subtle toasted coconut. Clinging mouth-coating finish.Â Â Â£2250
Lagavulin 1993 Islay Jazz Festival bottling (bottled 2011) 55.4%,Single Malt Scotch,93,127,An extremely limited edition issued at last year's Islay Jazz Fest this was chosen by warehouseman Iain McArthur as a prime example of a â€˜bodega' sherry butt (see page XX for more on the â€˜bodega' process). It is simply massive with concentrated soy/balsamic notes combining with hot embers burning rosemary fig coffee and candied peels. The smokiness is unrestrained on the tongue; all soot earth and a rolling wave of deep pimento-accented meatiness leading to a kippery finish. Magnificent.  (Available only at the distillery)Â£80    
Lagavulin 1995 Feis Ile 2014 bottling 54.7%,Single Malt Scotch,93,167,A sherry-cask Lagavulin this immediately shows a rich mellow power with a touch of potter's wheel but it needs water to bring out sandalwood beach bonfire kombu Lapsang Souchong and bog myrtle. The palate is where it shows itself fully; resinous and thick unctuous even with that scented pine/juniper tea note shifting into paprika-rubbed ham membrillo currants blackberry. I've a feeling that this period will be seen as Lagavulin's golden age.Â Â£99
Lagavulin 25 year old 50.9%,Single Malt Scotch,93,1200,This cask strength sherry cask matured expression was released as part of Lagavulin's bicentennial celebration. The nose offers new leather tropical fruits brittle toffee and brine backed by spicy peat smoke. Smoky sherry notes open up in time. The rich well-mannered palate boasts sweet peat brine muted sherry figs gentle spices tangerines and lemons. Becoming more savory in the long gently smoky malty finish. Very drinkable at cask strength. A great Lagavulin. (8000 bottles)
Longrow 1974 25 year old 46%,Single Malt Scotch,93,525,Gold color. Peaty smoky mature aromas with notes of damp earth pencil shavings seaweed brine and vanilla. Oily viscous body. Flavors are similar to its aroma with a spicy salty black pepper dryish finish. 
Longrow 18 year old 46%,Single Malt Scotch,93,280,Straw/honey color. Light to medium weight with a slightly oily texture. Shy on the nose but makes up for it on the finish. Fresh brine toasted coconut bright citrus fruit and subtle mint on a bed of vanilla cream and honeyed malt. The peat smoke is restrained on the nose but is more assertive on the palate and it really kicks in on the finish which is briny smoky appetizing and long. The best Longrow since the 1974 vintage. If it would only just open up a little more on the nose it would challenge the best from â€˜73 and â€˜74. (Only 120 bottles for the U.S.)
The Macallan 50 year old 43%,Single Malt Scotch,93,3500,Amber-chestnut color. Aromas are very mature and so thick one almost needs a knife to cut it. Notes of dried fruit (orange lemons pineapple) and wood spices (especially clove) with more than a suggestion of peat smoke. Thick enveloping texture-like a warm coat on a bitterly cold day. Very mature. One can easily deduce this is a very old whisky-the woodiness is evident on the palate. But it is not in excess. There's plenty of dried fruit enticing wood spices and peat to keep the palate entertained all the way through to its very long dry finish. 
Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Mortlach) 11 year oldk 1993 vintage 60.7%,Single Malt Scotch,93,80,Full-flavored confident and very dynamic. Bright fruit teasing toffee complex spices cereal grain and underlying light leather notes are all tightly integrated. Think an 11 year old whisky can't be mature or complex? Think again! A Speyside powerhouse! (Available in the Chicago area.) 
Mortlach 18 year old 43.4%,Single Malt Scotch,93,304,Deep amber in color with the green glints of first-fill sherry this has bosky notes and meatâ€”mutton and venisonâ€”plus graphite bitter chocolate and wet rock before layers of dried stone fruits and date. This is the most savory and Bovril-like of the new range. The palate is feral and earthy; think mushroom with game pie and rowan berries. Deep but with more dimensions than the previous 16 year old which in comparison seems like a blunt instrument.Â Â£180/500 ml
Port Ellen 30 year old (2009 Release) 57.7% ,Single Malt Scotch,93,370,Port Ellen whiskies are just going to keep getting rarer and more expensive. This old-fashioned whisky is beginning to show its age but is still holding up nicely. It's clean with no excessive oak and a soft sweet maltiness for balance. Earthy and rooty at times with tarry rope beach pebbles leafy smoke bourbon barrel char black licorice lemon peel and hints of shellfish and diesel fumes (like following a boat in the ocean). Long smoky lightly briny finish.
Port Ellen 31 year old 54.6%,Single Malt Scotch,93,455,Now the one that peat freaks wait patiently for every year which makes it the bottling that produces the most debate. For me this is up there with last year's bottling which itself ushered in a return to high standards after a slight dropping-off in expressiveness. This is different however. Yes the color is as pale as ever â€” has anyone ever tasted an over-oaked Port Ellen? â€” and yes the nose initially shows all of the distillery's austere notes: think of a wet fish counter and the sensation of the sea rather than overt â€˜fishiness' while there's also a chilled cucumber note. The difference is the sweetness which is more to the fore and also it would seem a slight dropping-off in massive smokiness. Here the peat is integrated into the whole. The palate has a numb spot right on the front then wasabi-like heat coupled with olive oil. Soon the sea rolls in and it stands there like some creature from the Black Lagoon covered with balls of tar draped in wet seaweed encrusted with barnacles and clams â€” and clutching a kipper. But don't forget the sweetness that spreads across the tongue and slowly drifts into fresh spice and antiseptic. Complexâ€¦and there's a scant 3000 bottled for the globe. 
Port Ellen 1978 35 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014) 56.5%,Single Malt Scotch,93,3300,Scarcity and the secondary market have driven prices up so either buddy-up to a rich guy or club together to try this. Greater levels of cask interaction have added an extra dimension to a whisky that is often skeletal. The smoke's in the background as salted cashew peppermint tansy furniture polish and smoked meats take center stage. The palate is slowly expanding and smoked with some chocolate and wax. Finally a Port Ellen that is truly classically mature. A killer. (2964 bottles)
Port Ellen 37 year old 55.2%,Single Malt Scotch,93,4000,The sixteenth Special Releases Port Ellen is the oldest to date. Initially sea breeze on the nose brine rock pools and gentle iodine followed by dried fruits peat and wood polish. Full-bodied very silky again with brine to the fore plus sweet peat drying slowly ginger black pepper and balancing tropical fruit notes. The finish is long with burnt oak embers and licorice. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (2900 bottles)
Port Ellen 37 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017) 51%,Single Malt Scotch,93,3500,This 1979 vintage is the 17th Special Releases Port Ellen. It has been aged in refill American oak hogsheads and butts. The nose offers fresh-mown grass ripe pears and damp tweed before smoked fish and bonfire aromas emerge. The oily palate features spicy peat barbecued meat and peaches in syrup. Very long in the finish; smoky and earthy with a hint of chili and mouth-drying tannins. (2988 bottles)
Springbank 35 year old 46%,Single Malt Scotch,93,580,Antique amber color. Mature complex aromas especially in wood spice notes. In addition to wood spices I also found notes of roasted nuts coconuts orange marmalade anise and subtle brine. Thick and syrupy in texture with complex flavors that echo its aroma. The depth on the palate is incredible! Long lingering finish. 
Murray McDavid (distilled at Springbank) 1965 34 year old 46%,Single Malt Scotch,93,200,Antique amber color. Ripe fallen fruit aromas laced with coconut marshmallow and almonds. The sherry cask influence is very prominent on the nose but the Springbank brine character still manages to fight through. Full bodied with a soothing texture. Huge flavors with great balance and depth consisting of exotic fruits complex wood spices brine and coconut. Long lingering satisfying finish. 
Duncan Taylor (distilled at Strathisla) 35 year old Cask #7009 45.1%,Single Malt Scotch,93,240,Aromatically fruity and quite full with wonderful depth on the nose and palate. The fruit (golden raisins apricot red licorice papaya) is balanced by restrained honey vanilla and fennel. The whisky is always dry but never excessively so. A delicious ultra-mature whisky. 
Talisker 30 year old 51.9%,Single Malt Scotch,93,300,Surprisingly clean and youthful for a 30 year old both on the nose and palate. Complex too with a sea breeze freshness vanilla malt polished oak spice smoked seaweed lightly tarred boat docks toasted nuts and lingering telicherry pepper. Mature yet still quite powerful. Rivals the original Talisker 25 year old and the Talisker 18 year old as one of the finest Talisker whiskies ever released. 
Talisker 18 year old 45.8%,Single Malt Scotch,93,65,A sophisticated and refined Talisker if that's not an oxymoron. But this is certainly true when compared to the 10 year old. This 18 year old is deeper too with less of the fishnets more of oak boat docks. Less lemongrass more fruit gum drops. There's still that knock-out punch on the finish. There's a fine line between polishing the rough edges of a beautifully powerful whisky and ripping its heart and soul out with a knife by dumbing it down. This whisky has not crossed that line. A fabulous whisky! 
Glen Moray 25 year old Port Cask Finish 43%,Single Malt Scotch,93,300,Distilled in 1988 and finished for an unspecified period in port casks after lengthy maturation in bourbon barrels. Floral perfumed and very enticing on the nose. Vanilla fudge cocktail cherries polished oak and gentle spices. Soft and sweet on the palate with vanilla overripe orange cinnamon and milky coffee. Long and slightly peppery on the finish with persistent drying fruitiness. Complex and extremely accomplished.
Convalmore 1977 28 year old 57.9%,Single Malt Scotch,93,248,OK confession time. This remains one of my favorite whiskies ever a classic example of what long slow aging in a refill cask can do for a whisky â€” increase its unctuous nature bring out butterscotch ginseng honey deepen the orchard fruits and release a dazzling spiciness on the tongue. It has balance it has finesse and there's not much left. Â£155(Not available in the U.S.)
Dailuaine 1980 34 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015) 50.9%,Single Malt Scotch,93,2000,That rarely-spotted beast Dailuaine gets the Special Release treatment. This example has come from refill American oak and has immediate marzipan notes on top of the distillery's fascinating mix of meaty density and sweetness. In time there are fat fruits Victoria plum bitter citrus faded green leafiness and chocolate notes. The palate is ripe rich and profound with a hint of tropical fruits cut with cacao. Long elegant and complex this is the best of this year's bunch for me.
That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Glenturret) 35 year old 48%,Single Malt Scotch,93,173,Sherry cask matured in its entirety this rich southern Highland beauty exudes a perfume of deep orange sweet cherry plum nutty fruitcake and pleasant oak. Beautifully balanced it showcases sweet orange red fruits baked Victoria plum and brown sugar while ginger and pepper sparkle across the tongue. Honey and stewed fruits mollify the throat. An absolute joy.
That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Macallan) 29 year old 43.5%,Single Malt Scotch,93,560,This has the poise and physique of a classic sherried Macallan. Hazelnut mixed peel peach cobbler and wood spices form a delightful olfactory combination. Warm weighty sherry notes bathe the mouth with ginger loaf milk chocolate chunks and espresso in support lilting toward a lip-smacking finish of peach melba and amontillado sherry. It's increasingly rare to find a top-quality aged independent Macallan so don't miss out.
Royal Salute 32 year old Union of the Crowns 43%,Single Malt Scotch,93,380,Containing some precious closed distillery stocks this feels like the height of luxury with its aromas of clove-studded oranges cinnamon sticks rich chocolate and caramels. It's slick and mouth-coating emitting flavors of butter toffee orange and melted chocolate with a nibble of ginger sponge Jaffa cakes and clove. It's smooth and impeccably well mannered. (Global Travel Retail only)
Exclusive Malts Speyside 25 year old 1989 Cask #3942 48.8%,Single Malt Scotch,93,200,Exclusive Malts doesn't disclose the source distillery which doesn't matter when you've got a whisky that's a gem. Apple cider defines the nose and is complemented by ginger and iris. On the palate this whisky is lush but well balanced with honeyed apple cider gingerbread cookie and baked apple. In the center of all this is rancio. Ginger spice and baked apple define the finish which is long and flavorful. Great balance integration and flavor. What more can you ask for? (U.S. only)
The Scotch Malt Whisky Society Pigs in Plaster 14 year old (#4.1980) 59.1%,Single Malt Scotch,93,140,This single cask distilled at Highland Park is an excellent example of why distilleries sell off certain casks. On the nose it's Highland Park's signature sherry and peat but on the palate it's a beast. Monster peat smoke surfs on a lush layer of berry and malt. This builds to a peak with smoke salt and oak spice bolstered by the high proof. A smoky dry finish rounds off a monster whisky different from Highland Park's style but very interesting. (Julio's Liquors only)
Mackillop's Choice (distilled at Mortlach) 1991 56.6%,Single Malt Scotch,93,290,Full gold. Weighty but not oppressed by wood. Full rich rancio aroma which brings to mind an ancient cognac. It is rich and powerful but has great finesse and perfect balance: cooked fruit some spice a lot of waxiness licoriceâ€¦and then the distillery's signature meatiness. The palate starts sweetly with ripe old autumn fruits and soft tannins. This has everything you want from a mature whisky and from Mortlach with added elegance. Highly recommended.Â Â£198
Duncan Taylor â€œNC2â€ (distilled at Aberlour) 16 year old 46%,Single Malt Scotch,92,80,This whisky packs a lot of clean complex and well-balanced flavors. It features a creamy layered malty-sweet foundation (vanilla caramel toffee) chock full of bright fruit (golden raisin honeyed orchard fruit currant) rounded out by firm dried spice (cinnamon nutmeg mint) that dances on the palate. Long warming spicy finish. Nicely done!
Aberlour 18 year old 43%,Single Malt Scotch,92,125,This has a significant proportion of sherry wood and it marks a real step up from its younger stablemates. It boasts a stylish nose of old leathery cigar boxes vanilla and orange marmalade. Syrupy on the palate with oranges sweet sherry honey and figs. Spicy oak caramel citrus fruits and aniseed in the lengthy finish.
Aberfeldy Single Cask (Cask No. 5) 16 year old 57.4%,Single Malt Scotch,92,250,From a sherry cask. Bright and lively. Quite fruity with notes of golden raisin pineapple nectarine and tangerine. The fruit is balanced by honeyed malt and light caramel. A dusting of vanilla cinnamon and hint of cocoa with black licorice on the finish. Lush and mouth-coating. The best of the Aberfeldy whiskies I've tasted to date. (New Hampshire only)
Ardbeg Airidh Nam Beist 1990 Vintage 46%,Single Malt Scotch,92,100,Some of the best intensely smoky peaty Islay whiskies are balanced with a foundation of malty sweetness. This whisky is an excellent example. A sinewy malt with the classic bold notes of kiln smoke peat tarry rope and coal ash. Sweeter notes of honeyed malt ripe vanilla chocolate fudge and toasted marshmallow temper and sooth the palate along with background berry confit. The smoke lingers long on the palate. Ardbeg devotees will not be disappointed. 
Ardbeg Alligator 51.2%,Single Malt Scotch,92,95,Similar to the standard Ardbeg 10 year old except that a portion of the whisky was aged in heavily charred barrels (referred to as an â€œalligatorâ€ char). An aggressive whisky â€” even for Ardbeg â€” with a leathery texture throughout. Dynamic too with coal tar soot bourbon barrel char espresso cocoa licorice root smoked fish and a hint of ginger. There's a nice creamy vanilla underbelly to balance the aggressiveness and (at least partially) muzzle the Alligator. 
Ardmore 100th Anniversary 12 year old 40%,Single Malt Scotch,92,155,This isn't quite a distillery-only bottling so much as a bottle only available at the distillery â€” which isn't exactly the same thing. Bottled more than 10 years ago to mark the distillery's centenary incredibly a small amount is still available and it is well worth pursuing.Until relatively recently Ardmore was an industry secret cherished by those in the know. But the peaty and feisty no-age-statement Ardmore Traditional has introduced the malt to a new generation of drinkers and last year's sweet and fruity 25 year old suggested that the distillery has a potentially diverse range of future treasures to be excited about. This bottling is light soft sweet and juicy. Orange flavors and peat team up to steer a middle way for what is a delicious and highly more-ish malt. Its only flaw is in the finish which dies away too quickly for this palate. Perhaps a slightly higher strength would have improved it. No matter it's like the fade out of the guitar solo at the end of your favorite track; it's a bit frustrating because you want it to go on and on but it doesn't stop you going back and listening to it all again.
Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #2) 50.6%,Single Malt Scotch,92,263,A vatting of selected casks located at Balvenie's No. 24 warehouse in Dufftown this is made up of seven ex-bourbon casks and three butts whose ages range from 1967 to 1989 all of which are then â€˜married' in a large vat (aka a â€˜tun'). There's classic Balvenie honey along with macadamia pistachio and caramelized fruits. As it opens it shifts into a high-class gentleman's cologne: musk and sandalwood with some mulberry to add depth. Elegant and magnificent.  Â£165
BenRiach Pedro Ximinez Finish (Cask #7165) 1995 Vintage 52.3%,Single Malt Scotch,92,95,This is the heavily peated expression of BenRiach. (BenRiach does not differentiate their peated expressions with a different name as Springbank does with Longrow or Tobermory with Ledaig.) It's also finished with the dark lush â€œPXâ€ sherry. Both influences are very evident with the deep heavy earthy smoky notes complemented by dark fleshy dried fruit. I think the two different influences marry very nicely here and I really enjoy drinking it. (Bottling at cask strength is a bonus!)
Benromach 1974 (cask 1583) 49.1%,Single Malt Scotch,92,1600,This 41 year old single cask was aged in a sherry butt and interacted magnificently with that wood. The nose offers peeled red apples sultanas honey fudge milk chocolate and American cream soda. Balanced and harmonious throughout the palate yields remarkably fresh orchard fruits pipe tobacco black pepper and ginger. Long in the finish with cinnamon drying to dark chocolate and slightly smoky unobtrusively tannic oak. A 1970s classic!
Benromach Heritage 1973 48.9%,Single Malt Scotch,92,1722,This 42 year old expression was matured in a single American oak hogshead (#4606) and offers a lovely mature fruity nose especially peaches and pineapple plus vanilla and marzipan. Smooth and rich on the palate with sherry hessian and spicy pineapple. Dries steadily but satisfyingly with a hint of smoky fruit. Another veteran classic from the team at Forres. (52 bottles) Â£1400
Bowmore Oloroso Sherry Cask 1964 Vintage,Single Malt Scotch,92,1500,Mahogany color. Medium to full in body and rich. Aroma and flavors are very reminiscent of the Black Bowmore releases: burnt fruit roasted nuts fruit cake polished leather wood resin and just a teasing of smoke. There is a harmonious balance between the dry oak spices and the sweet fruity oloroso sherry notes. Soothing finish.Â Â Â Style: Islay single malt Scotch whisky. Price: Approx. $1500. Only 300 bottles available this fall at specialty retailers nationwide.Â Â Â Â This whisky was distilled around the same time-and is very similar in flavor profile-as the legendary Black Bowmore whiskies released several years ago. Comparing this release with the Black Bowmore is only natural. Having tried this whisky next to the previous Black Bowmores I can happily say that this whisky is as good as they are (although a lot more expensive). While the original Black Bowmore whiskies are a little bigger and fuller in body (especially towards the finish) this new 1964 Vintage is a tad softer sweeter more rounded and more seductive. This is a very contemplative whisky-the more attention you devote to it the more pleasure it gives you.
Bruichladdich 'PC-5' 63.5%,Single Malt Scotch,92,120,This is a five year old expression of the more highly peated Bruichladdich whisky being referred to as Port Charlotte (named after the now-silent distillery down the road from Bruichladdich). More highly peated indeed. If you like your smoky Islay whiskies young and masculine this one is for you. It's like sticking your head in a peat-fired kiln. But there's more to this whisky than massive smoke. There are underlying notes of kippers soot and tar. With further investigation there are spice notes of black pepper and black licorice stick. What really makes this whisky multi-dimensional and balanced is its sweet underbelly of thick toffee jammy fruit and almond butter. Youthful but not immature.
